### _Notes from conversation with Julian:_

1. Low-hanging fruit: Effect of connectivity on (a) species and functional group diversity and abundance
1. Next level: Movement & Dispersal. There are large areas of forest where it is possible to capture beetles for Mark-Release-Recapture (MRR) experiments.
1. Higher-risk, Higher reward (even if they don't go in MS, can be set-up for potential PHD projects): Experiments on Ecosystem Services 

- dung burial, decomposition, soil properties based on results of 1 & 2 (buckets with dung and beetle assemblages)
- gas (e.g., methane) emissions
- seed dispersal/burial/germination


### Example studies

1. Diversity and Abundance


+ @WOS:000178929600002: "56% of individuals were capturedin the continuous forest, 29% in the mosaic habitat and 15% in the forest fragments"

2. Movement & Dispersal


3. Ecosystem Services


# Other stuff to work on:

1. Species List & Keys for Dung Beetles of the Southeastern US
1. Any previous work done on dung beetles in Southeastern US
1. List of Equipment and Tools needed
+ Dung beetle traps
+ alcohol
+ bait




# Species 


# THE QUESTIONS

1. Question 1: Is dung beetle abundance greater in patches connected by corridors?

I predict that____ ( the nuance based on type, flighht ability, etc)

1. Question 2: Is dung beetle diversity greater in patches connected by corridors?




2.  (movement): are dung beetles using corridors  


3.
