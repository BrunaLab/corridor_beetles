INTRODUCTION

These movements are hypothesized to prevent species diversity from
declining in fragments, as well as help maintain the ecosystem services
provided by these species (at both the patch- and landscape-level)(Burt
et al. 2022). Although there is some evidence that animals disperse
between patches via corridors, and that connected patches have higher
species diversity than unconnected ones, little work to date has
investigated the consequences of these corridor-driven patterns for
ecosystem services.

Dung beetles have emerged as a model system with which to test
hypotheses on how changes in landscape structure driven by human
activities influence biodiversity and their ecosystem services (Roslin
2000, RÃ¶s et al. 2012). The removal, breakdown, and burial of animal
feces is an important ecosystem service provided by dung beetles such as
enhanced nutrient cycling and soil quality and reduction of parasites on
methane emissions from dung (Iwasa et al. 2015, Slade et al. 2016).
Local assemblages of dung beetles can be species-rich with species
comprising a broad range of functional traits (e.g., size, foraging
style, resource-use) (deCastro-Arrazola et al. 2023). Previous studies
have shown that isolated patches of habitat frequently have lower dung
beetle diversity and abundance than areas of continuous habitat, as well
as documented their presence in linear strips of habitat that resemble
corridors (Gray et al. 2022). However, it remains unknown if corridors
actually act to reduce the loss of dung beetle species from fragments,
if such declines are influenced by inter-specific differences in
dispersal capability, and what the consequences of these patterns are
for the ecosystems services they provide. One major factor behind this
lack of information is the challenge in finding locations where one can
assess the role of corridors while also while controlling for
confounding factors such as patch size, edge, and corridor length
(Haddad 2015).

\textbf{We sampled the commmunity of of dung beetles at the SRS Corridor
Experiment to test the following prediction:} Species Richness, Species
Diversity, and Functional Diversity will be higher in patches connected
by corridors than in unconnected patches.

  First Paragraph: What is the topic of your introduction and why is it
  important/interesting/relevant?
\end{itemize}

As human disturbances continue to expand into natural landscapes, intact
habitats are becoming increasingly fragmented. This degradation lends to
loss in biodiversity on a global scale and interruptions in ecosystem
processes and functions (Haddad 2015). Effects from isolation can vary,
however as habitats are broken down community structures are
significantly altered (Laurance et al. 2018). Corridors have been shown
to be an important mechanism for facilitating the movement of organisms
through fragmented landscapes with the goal of minimizing negative
consequences of fragmentation(Haddad et al. 2003). As disturbance
continues to intensify, it is becoming increasingly more important to
understand how different taxonomic groups. Here, we aim to gain an
understanding of how dung beetles, a group of insects well known for
strong dispersal ability in order to compete for ephemeral
resources(Hanski and Cambefort 1991), interact with corridors in their
landscapes.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Second Paragraph: What is known about this topic already?
\end{itemize}

Effects of landscape change are already very well studied, accross
different taxa . effects of edge, patch size, and direct habitat loss.
using corridors to connect fragmented landscapes is also well studied
and for many taxa. dung beetles as a model system for studying movement,
functional diversity, and ecosystem health. dung beetle populations in
connected and fragmented habitats . insect declines in fragmented
landscapes.

\item
  Third Paragraph: What isn't known about this topic and why might it
  change how we think/act about the topic?
\end{itemize}

How corridors directly impact dung beetle communitites are changes
driven by dispersal ability

Dung beetles are an incredibly well studied group of insects which play
an important role in providng ecosystem services for dung removal,
secondary seed distribution, and even suppressing populations of
parasitic pests(Shepherd and Chapman 1998, Manning et al. 2016). Studies
have also focused on how landscape structures alter community
compositions(Costa et al. 2017), yet direect

at our study site we can directly compare patch connectivity and patch
shape with fragmented landscapes to obtain a strong idea of what
landscape features effect dung beetle collection.

Here sampled the commmunity of of dung beetles at the SRS Corridor
Experiment to test the following prediction:

Species richness, diversity, and functional diversity will be higher in

unconnected.

Study site

\begin{itemize}

  description of srs
\end{itemize}

Our study took place at the Savannah River Site(SRS), a National
Environmental Research Park in southern South Carolina, US(33.208 N,
81.408 W) in four of seven experimental landscapes designed for the
purposes of directly observing the impacts of corridors and patch shape
on the movements of plants and animals(Tewksbury et al. 2002). Each
experimental landscape, termed blocks, consists of four patches of open
habitat around a central patch all together within a matrix of pine
savanna. In each replicant the central patch (100 x 100 m) is always
connected to one peripheral patch with identical dimensions by a 150 x
25 m corridor, this will hereafter be referred to as the connected
patch. The remaining patches are either ``winged'' or ``rectangular''.
The winged patch is also 100 x 100 m, however they exhibit their
characteristic wings in the form of two 75 x 25 m offshoots meant to
account for the extra area and edge space the corridor provides. The
rectangular patch is 100 x 137.5 m also the same area as the space of
the connected patch plus the corridor. Each block has a duplicate of
either the winged or rectangle patch, all peripheral patches being 150 m
from the center patch. For this study sampling was done in one of each
patch type and in one matrix plot per block, all matrix blocks were set
up 150 m away from the center as well.

Dung beetle sampling

In the months of July and August 2024 dung beetles were sampled in 4
blocks spread across SRS, baited pitfall traps were placed in one of
each patch type and in one matrix plot per block. Traps were placed in
groups of 3 in the centers of each patch approximately 250 meters from
the midpoint of the central patch 40 m from patch edge. Pitfalls were
oriented in a triangular pattern with the bottom two traps positioned
towards the center patch, each trap 20 m apart. Plots in the matrix were
set up in a similar fashion with the center point 250 m from the center
placed equidistant between adjacent patches. For each sample period,
traps were baited with pig dung between 8-9 pm and picked up 12 hours
later, all beetles captured were stored in ethanol for further
processing. In total 16 sampling rounds were carried out with 4 rounds
per block, 196 samples were collected. All dung beetles were counted and
identified to species with the exception of beetles of the genus
Aphodius, overall 15 species were identified and approximately 5300
individual beetles were collected.
