	abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbance causes many impacts across multiple levels of biological organization from populations to ecosystems. However, the extent of cross-taxon congruence in biotic responses to disturbance, and therefore the utility of using particular taxa as indicators of broader biotic responses, is poorly known. In this study, we examine the extent to which variation in alpha diversity, beta diversity and species composition of ants, fruit-feeding butterflies, dung beetles and termites in relation to fragment size are congruent in the highly fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest. Our results show generally low and inconsistent congruence, typically occurring for particular pairs of taxa only (such as butterflies and dung beetles for species composition, and ants and termites for Hill diversity-1D) or not at all (such as for species richness). In synthesis, there some universal community-level attributes and taxa (i.e., attributes responding consistently and congruently across taxa) have been proved to be sensitive in general. Vegetation structure and spatial location of fragments were not significant predictors of ant and termite species composition, but explained 21\% and 40\% of the variation in species composition of dung beetles and butterflies, respectively. In addition, we found no general increase in the ratio of generalists to specialists with decreasing fragment size. The overall lack of cross-taxon congruence means that a single taxon cannot provide a reliable indication of biotic responses to fragmentation in our study system. This can be explained by taxon-specific responses to variation in tree diversity, tree functional attributes and the spatial location of fragments. Our study therefore provides support for a multi-taxon approach to biodiversity monitoring and conservation planning.},

	abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms underpinning spatiotemporal diversity patterns of biological communities is a major goal of ecology. We aimed to test two ecological hypotheses: (i) temporal patterns of beta-diversity will mostly be driven by nestedness, with a loss of species from summer to winter, and (ii) nestedness values will correlate with climatic variables instead of turnover values, indicating either a loss of species during winter or a gain of species during summer. We sampled dung beetles using standardized sampling protocols along a year in four Atlantic forest sites: two at the northwest and two at the central region of Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil. We partitioned temporal patterns of beta-diversity into turnover and nestedness in order to investigate if community changes are driven by species substitution or gain/loss across time. Our results highlighted five main findings: (i) dung beetle composition varied more with sites than site geographic position; (ii) there was almost one and a half `true' dung beetle assemblages regarding the spatial distribution of species weighed by abundance; (iii) we found a positive influence of mean temperature and a negative influence of relative humidity on both species richness and abundance; (iv) both spatial and temporal dissimilarity among sites were dominated by species replacement, while the relative importance of nestedness was higher in temporal than spatial patterns; (v) there was an effect of precipitation and relative humidity on temporal patterns of beta-diversity components, but these effects were site-dependent. Contrary to our expectations, the beta-diversity component of turnover dominated both spatial and temporal patterns in dung beetle dissimilarity among sites and months. Distinct climatic variables affected differently the alpha-diversity and beta-diversity components of dung beetle assemblages. Partitioning beta-diversity into temporal components is a promising approach to unveil patterns of the community dynamics and to produce insights on mechanisms underlying such patterns.},

	abstract = {Few studies have quantified changes in riparian and adjacent forest across landscape units. In this study, the composition and structure of riparian and adjacent forest were compared in a humid and a semiarid ecoregion in northwestern Argentina: the Yungas forest and the Western Chaco. We expected that differences between riparian and adjacent zones could be less marked in humid than in semiarid regions. Ten sites were surveyed with a block design. An Importance Value Index, Rank-Abundance curves, and Analysis of Similarity and multivariate analyzes (NMDS) were performed to evaluate differences between forests. Stream and floodplain widths, lateral, and longitudinal slopes of streamside were analyzed by a principal components analysis (PCA). NMDS and PCA axes were correlated to analyze the relations among physical and biological arrangements. Results revealed that riparian forest may be very different from the adjacent in both ecoregions. Marked differences in geomorphological and physical features of streamsides were found between ecoregions and they were strongly associated with assemblage distribution. In Yungas forest, dominant species were different at all sites, according to the altitudinal stratification of this region. Within Western Chaco the species Salix humboldtiana Willd. and Tessaria integrifolia Ruiz and Pav., were commonly dominant in riparian sectors. The dominance of these species in both sectors by the widest rivers could indicate that the dimensions of the riparian zone in those sites are greater than those by the smaller streams. Our study reinforced the concept of riparian zones as dynamic ecosystems and we propose considering a landscape perspective in managerial decision making.},

	abstract = {1. Dung beetles are commonly assumed to be generalist feeders, but there has been limited work in identifying whether there is interspecific variation in feeding preference. Equally, there has been no work exploring whether generalist feeding behaviour in a species is a result of within-species specialisation. 2. This study identified the individual and species-level feeding preferences of five dung beetle species towards human, jaguar and pig dung using a choice experiment. 3. It was found that species varied in their preference for the dung types, but there was no evidence that within a species, individual beetles varied in their dung choice. These findings were similar to results from field experiments that are more typically used to assess feeding preferences in dung beetles. 4. The results suggest that individual specialism in feeding may not be common in dung beetles. However, there is variation in feeding preferences among species, which is often overlooked and can have implications for the ecosystem functions they provide. It is suggested that choice arenas can be used to assess feeding preferences in dung beetle species that are not abundant enough to reliably estimate dietary choice from field studies.},

We recorded a total of 106 species of ants and 30 species of dung beetle. The ant and dung beetle assemblages were related in different ways to patch and landscape attributes. Hypogeic ants were more sensitive to patch attributes, particularly vegetation composition, compared to landscape attributes. Epigeic ant assemblages are likely a disturbance indicator, or theassemblages have already homogenized across the region. Arboreal ant assemblages were particularly sensitive to fragmentation and responded to within-patch vegetation and landscape configuration. Dung beetles were more sensitive to landscape composition than to patch attributes. Given these findings, the biomonitoring of ants and dung beetles should focus on both patch and landscape attributesin fragmented landscapes to maintain the different ecosystem functions provided by them.},

	abstract = {In fragmented landscapes, the composition, diversity, and abundance of communities of various groups of organisms change from the edge inward the forest. To assess such changes in dung beetle assemblages, transects were established perpendicular to the edge in remnants of forest immersed in a heterogeneous matrix. The transects were in three types of edge: Forest-pastures, forest-natural regeneration and forest-highway, each with eight sampling stations at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 m from the edge towards the inside, and 30 and 60 m from the edge towards the matrix. At each station, we set up a pitfall trap baited with human excrement. Six environmental variables were evaluated. The changes in the assemblage of dung beetles were dependent of the edge type and became noticeable to maximum 3o m into the forest; however, stations from 60 to 150 m inward did not show significant changes in these parameters. The percentage of light, indirect measure of plant cover, was the most influential variable on the number of species, individuals and biomass of beetles. Although dung beetles appear to be less affected by the edge effect than other groups it is necessary to consider that 25 \% of species avoid the edge and that only a few species can move through the matrix, which can have consequences on the ecological function and the viability of their populations in the long term.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity changes in space and time generate complex gradients. These gradients affect community structures, generating beta diversity replacement patterns. The two main patterns of spatial replacement are turnover and nestedness. However, there are very few studies that analyze diversity changes along environmental gradients in the Colombian Caribbean region. In an attempt to understand these spatial changes, a complete sampling was conducted in five Colombian Caribbean ecoregions (Golfo de Morrosquillo, Montes de Maria, Sabanas, San Jorge, and La Mojana) using dung beetles as an indicator. In each region, a linear transect with 20 pitfall traps baited with dung was established. Differences in abundance, richness, Shannon-index, evenness, and beta diversity between ecoregions were evaluated. A total of 923 individuals belonging to 27 species were collected. The tribe Deltochilini and the genus Canthon were the most diverse. The most abundant species was Silvicanthon aequinoctialis. Significant differences were found in the parameters measured between the ecoregions. A Beta diversity index established a clear spatial pattern demonstrating high turnover with low nestedness values. The Montes de Maria ecoregion has the highest diversity, which was linked with the maintenance of conserved forest fragments. It is advisable to generate conservation strategies and the designation of a new National Natural Park for Montes de Maria in order to stop the negative impact caused by agricultural and cattle farming expansion in the region. This study represents the first effort to understand dung beetle spatial patterns within the ecoregions of the Colombian Caribbean region through connecting environmental gradients and spatial diversity dynamics.},

	abstract = {Human-modified forests, including plantations and managed forest, will be a major component of tropical landscapes in the near future. To conserve biodiversity across modified tropical landscapes we must first understand what influences diversity in planted areas. We studied dung beetle communities in Eucalyptus plantations to assess the influence of local (canopy openness and soil texture) and landscape factors (surrounding native forest cover) on taxonomic and functional diversity, and to determine whether biodiversity in plantations is affected by timber production. Dung beetle community composition in Eucalyptus plantations was largely explained by the surrounding native forest cover, as Simpson's diversity and functional diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy) increased with the extent of native forest in buffer areas. However, the abundance of dung beetle species associated with native forest was not explained by any of the explanatory variables. The coarse sand content of the soil explained much of the functional similarity between plantations and native forests, as well as variation in dung beetle community structure. The total abundance of dung beetles in plantations increased with coarse sand content, whereas body mass declined, and dung beetle abundance and functional originality decreased with canopy openness. Timber production intensity did not explain the variation in any of the measured diversity parameters. If enhancing biodiversity in plantations is a management goal, then these results highlight the importance of restoring or retaining native forest areas in modified landscapes. They also suggest that integrated management could improve biodiversity in Eucalyptus plantations without reducing timber production.},

	abstract = {1. We assessed differences in the alpha and beta diversity of dung beetles in native forest and two livestock systems (with and without canopy cover) typical of the Argentine Chaco region and related the dung beetle assemblages to environmental conditions. 2. Dung beetles were sampled in native forest and two livestock systems in the spring (2015-2016), in two areas of the humid Chaco region in northern Argentina. In each area, five sampling sites were selected for each habitat type, and ten pitfall traps were baited with human faeces and carrion and placed at each site. 3. The livestock systems with canopy cover preserved the environmental conditions from the native forest (temperature and vegetation structure) and the richness and composition of the native forest dung beetle community in the two areas studied, whereas the open pastures exhibited higher ground temperature, simplified vegetation structure and lower dung beetle richness and similarity in species composition in relation to the native forest. 4. In livestock systems of the humid Chaco, the canopy cover is the main determinant of dung beetle communities through the maintenance of temperature and humidity. In the light of these results, livestock production in silvopastoral systems preserving canopy cover can be an alternative compatible with conservation of the dung beetle diversity of native forests. Considering the central role of dung beetles in maintaining soil structure and fertility (through the relocation of cow dung), silvopastoral systems will probably maintain the productivity compared to open pastures.},

	abstract = {The effect of sexual selection on species persistence remains unclear. The cost of bearing ornaments or armaments might increase extinction risk, but sexual selection can also enhance the spread of beneficial alleles and increase the removal of deleterious alleles, potentially reducing extinction risk. Here we investigate the effect of sexual selection on species persistence in a community of 34 species of dung beetles across a gradient of environmental disturbance ranging from old growth forest to oil palm plantation. Horns are sexually selected traits used in contests between males, and we find that both horn presence and relative size are strongly positively associated with species persistence and abundance in altered habitats. Testes mass, an indicator of post-copulatory selection, is, however, negatively linked with the abundance of species within the most disturbed habitats. This study represents the first evidence from a field system of a population-level benefit from pre-copulatory sexual selection.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.biocon.2019.03.045},
	abstract = {Forests are sensitive ecosystems with a distinctive micro-climate to which forest arthropods have adapted. In intact primary forests, sunlight only fully reaches forest floors temporarily through tree fall, or more permanently at forest edges. Roads that cut through pristine forests are however permanent features that fragment forests and increase forest edge. In accordance with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), these edges may allow generalist species to enter forests and replace some specialists, often leading to little change, or even higher numbers of arthropod species at edges. Here, we determined how roads and hiking trails affect epigaeic forest arthropods in the largest Afrotemperate forest complex in South Africa. Arthropods were collected using pitfall traps along transects set up perpendicular to different types of road, including wide arterial roads, narrower secondary roads and hiking trails. As expected, hiking trails affected arthropod assemblages to a much smaller extent than the roads. Edge effects, as measured by arthropod alpha diversity, were evident up to only 5 m for hiking trails yet as much as 20 m for secondary roads and ¿ 50 m into the adjoining forest for arterial roads. Our results support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, as changes in beta-diversity, especially next to arterial roads, was driven by the replacement of species in conjunction with changes in species richness. The magnitude of edge effect was however different for the selected feeding guilds. We recommend that where possible roads and even many hiking trails are removed from many areas of the deep forests. These ancient Afrotemperate forests are fragmented by roads and to a lesser degree by hiking trails, which could have cascading effects on overall forest integrity and long-term impacts on these forests.},

	abstract = {The maintenance of forest fragments within urban landscapes is essential for human well-being, as the loss of biodiversity may result in a reduction of ecological services in cities. Conserving diverse functional groups within urban landscapes is essential, since it is directly related with the resilience of such ecosystems. Through the use of indicator groups, it is possible to draw predictions on how communities respond to increasing urbanization. The goal of our study was to assess how the increase of urban land cover affects the assemblage and functional groups of dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) that inhabit forest fragments in a tropical city. We sampled dung beetles in nine fragments embedded in the metropolitan region of Joao Pessoa, Brazil. Increasing urbanization negatively affected the abundance of coprophagous species, as well as the species richness, abundance and biomass of roller beetles. Assemblages from the most urbanized forest fragments were significantly different from the other fragments. According to the decomposition of beta diversity, species turnover was the main process shaping the dung beetle assemblages in Joao Pessoa. In this study we provide evidence that specific functional groups of dung beetles are affected by urbanization. Furthermore, as each functional group has different strategies to occupy habitats and use resources, urbanization has contrasting effects for each group. Our results confirm that dung beetles are highly sensitive to urbanization and that protected areas within cities are fundamental to conserve biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Understanding how common vs. rare species contribute to species richness patterns, and are differentially affected by landscape features, is essential for effective conservation monitoring and planning. Using common vs. rare dung beetles and ants, we test how species rarity shapes richness patterns across a timber plantation mosaic with remnant natural grassland conservation corridors as a mitigation measure. We then determine how environmental and spatial factors shape assemblage composition of common and rare grassland species, and how matrix-derived species influence these patterns. For each taxon, species were ranked from common-to-rare, and from rare-to-common. This ranking gave sequences of species richness patterns for increasing numbers of species. Along each stage of these two sequences, species richness of the sub-assemblage was correlated with that of the whole assemblage. This was repeated with matrix-derived species excluded. Deconstructing the species response matrices according to species traits, variation in composition of common vs. rare grassland specialists, as well as in matrix-derived species, were related to environmental (natural environmental heterogeneity and habitat quality) and spatial factors. For both taxa, common species reflected overall species richness patterns better than rare species. Matrix-derived species reduced the contribution of rare species to species richness patterns of dung beetles. Environmental variables were relatively more important for rare species than for common species composition, especially rare ants. We found that in a fragmented landscape: 1) common species reflect overall species richness patterns better than rare species, 2) overall species richness patterns do not reflect those of rare species, 3) the relative influence of regional-and local-scale factors are determined by an organism's scale of life function, 4) rare species are especially affected by habitat quality, 5) knowledge of ecological processes governing communities in landscape mosaics are crucial for conserving grassland species diversity within these corridors.},

	abstract = {Dung beetles are insects involved in the organic matter cycle, providing services in ecosystem functions through their feeding and reproductive behavior. Environmental degradation of the Atlantic Forest in Brazil causes a decrease in species richness, which may affect ecosystem processes. However, many of the characteristics related to the ecological functions of dung beetle species remains unknown. Our study aimed to describe the ecological characteristics of dung beetle species that inhabit the natural forest environments of Santa Catarina state, southern Brazil. We used databases from research conducted from 2007 through 2014 coupled with standardized sampling methods to capture copro-necrophagous Scarabaeinae in 103 native Atlantic forest areas in 20 locations in the state of Santa Catarina. The 98 species collected, representing six tribes and 20 genera, were identified, photographed to scale and categorized according to their feeding habit, resource allocation behavior, did activity, relative abundance, body size, and distribution range in the state. Most of the species were of small size (n = 54) and tunnelers (n = 47), and almost half of the species (n = 42) were found only in one site, while 85 species were considered rare in relative abundance. In addition to contributing to the knowledge of dung beetle ecology in Brazil's Atlantic Forest, this study shows the species distribution in the region and highlights the importance of remaining forest fragments in the maintenance of biodiversity and the ecosystem functions carried out by these beetles.},

	abstract = {Fire as a tool in soil preparation for agriculture and livestock is a practice commonly used by farmers. However, these can cause forest fires of great consequences on fauna and flora. For this reason, this study evaluated the response of the dung beetles community to habitat modification caused by a forest fire in the Bijibana Reserve, Atlantico-Colombia. Two samplings were conducted on a forest fragment and 2 surrounding habitats (pasture and hedgerow) after the fire, and were compared with data collected in those places before the fire. 14,307 individuals comprising 22 species were collected. High values of species richness, diversity and biomass were observed in the forest before the fire and the lowest in the same place after the incident. Some Scarabaeinae species experienced significant decreases on their abundances after the forest fire; while others enhanced their number of individuals and a small group did not show changes in its abundance. The results demonstrate the negative effect of forest fires on the richness, abundance, diversity and biomass of dung beetles species. However, in an individual context, some species were benefited for the disturbance, enhancing its number of individuals and taking over sectors of the reserve where they were absent before.},

	abstract = {Naturally fragmented landscapes provide a suitable opportunity for investigating species dynamics under the sole influence of habitat fragmentation. Various approaches have used landscape attributes (e.g., patch size and connectivity) to explain patterns of species diversity and composition. We evaluated the influence that patch and landscape attributes have on bee and wasp (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) diversity (species richness and abundance) using a natural forest archipelago located in a campo rupestre (rupestrian grassland) matrix. We also assessed the effects of season on species composition (temporal beta-diversity). Our analysis found higher richness and abundance of bees and wasps in the summer. There was a significant change in species composition between seasons (species replacement accounts for 88\% of beta-diversity), with winter communities not representing subsets of summer communities. Evaluation of the relationships between bee and wasp diversity and landscape attributes (e.g., patch size and isolation, distance between patches and continuous forest distance), only found a significant relationship for temporal beta-diversity, which increases with distance from continuous forest. We propose that forest islands can be considered transient environments for many species, and so this naturally fragmented metacommunity depends on continuous forest propagules and its temporal dynamics to sustain diversity among forest islands.},

Specimens of Coprophanaeus ensifer show variations in size and colour between populations from different habitats, but other morphological structures remain the same. Our aim was to investigate whether these local populations of C. ensifer should be considered different species or not. A fragment of COI (681bp) was sequenced from eighty-four specimens of five Coprophanaeus species: C. ensifer, Coprophanaeus lancifer, Coprophanaeus bonariensis, Coprophanaeus bellicosus, and Coprophanaeus spitzi. We estimated an optimal threshold on SPIDER and based on its value we corroborated the five species analysed. In addition, all species were recovered as coalescent lineages by the GMYC method, except for C. lancifer. Sixty-seven sequences of C. ensifer were submitted to an analysis of haplotypic diversity and molecular variance, and 34 different haplotypes were found, with ten shared by two individuals or more. No evidence for cryptic or separate species of C. ensifer was found based on the AMOVA and haplotype network of COI sequences. (C) 2019 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Dung beetles (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae) are known to respond sensitive to habitat changes, but difficulties in the delineation of species together with their high local diversity have hindered the generalization of results. Morphological traits instead may better reflect species' adaptations to habitat changes. We investigated changes in morphological traits of 41 tunnelling dung beetle species in a sequence of land use change from primary forests, to secondary forests and meadows in a tropical karst mountain ecosystem in Vietnam (South East Asia). Tunnellers were by far the dominant functional group of dung beetles in these ecosystems. In addition, we measured dung removal rate as a key ecosystem service of these beetles. By combining RLQ and fourth-corner methods to characterize shifts in morphological species traits, we identified three distinct morphological trait clusters of dung beetles, reflecting distinct community adaptations to land use changes. Meadows, despite harbouring highest dung beetle abundance and species richness were severely impoverished in large-bodied dung beetles. The large-bodied dung beetles however, turned out to play crucial roles for dung removal. These data indicate that land use change led to significant changes of species traits in dung beetle communities which in turn fed back on critical ecosystem services. Our data demonstrate that trait-based approaches are well suited to describe the functional implications of environmental changes on species-rich arthropod communities and may better allow generalizations of adaptive responses between ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The diversity of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) is affected by urbanization, habitat fragmentation and disappearance of native mammals, which result in changes in the quality and availability of food, and resources for nesting. We evaluated the diversity, distribution of species in different trophic guilds and foraging strategies, and temporal variation in abundance of dung beetles in an urban fragment of Cerrado in a Federal District of Brazil. This study was conducted at the Experimental Station of Biology (EEB) of the University of Brasilia (UnB), Federal District, Brazil. Fortnightly, between October 2012 and September 2013, Scarabaeinae were collected using baited (human faeces, pig meat, or banana) and unbaited pitfall traps. Aspects of the dung beetle assemblage were evaluated, including species richness and abundance, feeding habits and foraging strategies. A total of 614 individuals were collected, which included eight species belonging to seven genera and four tribes. Dichotomius carbonarius (Mannerheim, 1829), a generalist species, dominated the assemblage, indicating that it is adapted to living in fragmented and urbanized areas. As regards feeding habits, Eurystemus caribaeus (Jablonsky \& Herbst, 1789) was considered to be strictly coprophagous, Coprophanaeus cyanescens (d'Olsoufieff, 1924) copronecrophagous and D. carbonarius a generalist. Most species were classified as paracoprids, which accounted for 75\% of the species collected. Regarding the attractiveness of the bait, the highest numbers of individuals and species were recorded in pitfall traps baited with human faeces. A high abundance of Scarabaeinae was recorded in the first half of the rainy season (October-December) with 98.2\% of the individuals collected in this period. The urban area studied harboured a low number of species with high abundance of a few species.},

	abstract = {Streblopus Van Lansberge, 1874 has been one of the most mysterious dung beetle groups of the Neotropical fauna, having a rather peculiar morphology, very few known specimens in collections and a difficult placement among the scarabaeine lineages. In this work, based on the examination of a recently collected series of specimens and a synthesis of some scattered, but deeply valuable, information available in the literature, we readdress many of the questions posed by past authors. It is shown that Streblopus is a relict genus composed of two currently living species of widely disjunct distribution, namely S. opatroides Van Lansbcrge, 1874, from patches of Atlantic Forest in the Brazilian states of Bahia and Espirito Santo, and S. punctatus (Balthasar, 1938), known from a few localities across SubAndean humid forests in the Peruvian and Ecuadorian Amazon Forest. We redescribe both and present in detail the evidence pointing to their validity as two independent species; a discussion of their remarkable sexual dimorphism is also given. The biogeography of Streblopus in South America is addressed, and we conclude that the present disjunct distribution of the genus is a consequence of the retreat of the tropical forest corridors that once connected the Atlantic Forest to the Amazon Basin through the South American Dry Diagonal during several periods of the Neogene, particularly until the Middle Miocene. Finally, we propose an African origin for the genus based on its close phylogenetic relationship with a group of Old World taxa - particularly Circellium Latreille, 1825 and Scarabaeini. Having diverged from those groups in the late Upper Cretaceous, we argue that the ancestor of Streblopus arrived in South America crossing the Atlantic Ocean by rafting. We present a synthesis of data from a wide variety of biological groups to support our ideas and contend that long-distance dispersal hypotheses should be taken more seriously by scarab beetle specialists.},

	abstract = {Studies addressing the temporal changes of ecological communities within fragmented forests transformed into natural protected areas are urgently needed. The creation of the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve (LTBR) in 1998 stopped the deforestation process of the northernmost tropical rainforest of the Neotropical region, allowing the analysis of the long-term effects on native communities after the halting of habitat fragmentation. We compared the diversity of dung beetles in 11 forest fragments and eight pastures in the LTBR between two periods: 1999-2000, the early years after the creation of the LTBR; and 2016-2017, i.e., 17 years later. Species richness and abundance of dung beetles were similar in both periods, being higher in forest fragments than in pastures; however, the dominant species were different in each period in both forest fragments and pastures. The number of habitat indicator species increased in 2016-2017 compared to 1999-2000, with a high species diversity of forest indicators relative to pasture indicators at both periods. Alpha and gamma diversifies were lower in 1999-2000 than in 2016-2017. Beta-diversity at the spatial level was strongly driven by species turnover, which was higher in pastures than in forest fragments. All functional groups (dwellers, rollers, and tunnellers) showed higher abundances in forest fragments than in pastures in both 1999-2000 and 2016-2017 periods. Our results suggest that stopping the fragmentation process in the LTBR has allowed the survival of native dung beetle assemblages, which are undergoing a recovery process of their populations and ecological functions over the years.},

	abstract = {Land use change is a global threat to biodiversity. Besides converting natural landscapes into monocultures, the use of genetically modified organisms is increasing, even though their effects on natural assemblages are still poorly known. The possible effects of transgenic crops on ecosystems can be studied using ecological indicators, such as dung beetles. We assessed the effect of creole, conventional, and transgenic maize crops on dung beetle assemblages in a landscape that also contained forest fragments in southern Brazil. We established 15 blocks, five on each type of maize fields. Each block consisted of a landscape with native forests and maize fields. A total of 2126 dung beetles were captured, belonging to 38 species. The forest-crop landscape associated with creole maize had a greater richness of dung beetle species. Conversely, an impoverished assemblage was detected in the transgenic maize crop landscape. The reduction of indicator insect diversity in landscapes influenced by transgenic crops suggests that the type of maize fields influences biodiversity conservation. In addition, the negative effects of transgenic crops went beyond maize fields, reaching native forest fragments adjacent to crops.},

	abstract = {Background. Anthropized landscapes play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation, as they encompass about 90\% of the remaining tropical forest. Effective conservation strategies require a deep understanding of how anthropic disturbances determine diversity patterns across these landscapes. Here, we evaluated how attributes and assembly mechanisms of dung beetle communities vary across the Selva El Ocote Biosphere Reserve (REBISO) landscape. Methods. Community attributes (species diversity, abundance, and biomass) were assessed at the landscape scale, using spatial windows and vegetation classes. Windows were categorized as intact, variegated, or fragmented based on their percent cover of tropical forest. The vegetation classes analyzed were tropical forest, second-growth forest, and pastures. Results. We collected 15,457 individuals and 55 species. Variegated windows, tropical forests, and second-growth forests showed the highest diversity values, while the lowest values were found in intact windows and pastures. Landscape fragmentation was positively and strongly related to dung beetle diversity and negatively related to their abundance; biomass was positively associated with forest cover. Beta diversity was the primary driver of the high dung beetle diversity in the landscape analyzed. Discussion. The landscape heterogeneity and its biodiversity-friendly matrix facilitate the complementarity of dung beetle assemblages in the Selva El Ocote Biosphere Reserve. Random processes govern beta diversity patterns in intact and variegated windows. Therefore, vegetation cover in the region is sufficient to maintain a continuous flow of dung beetles between forested landscape segments. However, intense anthropic disturbances acted as deterministic environmental filters in fragmented windows and pastures sites, leading to biotic homogenization processes. Our results suggest that increasing habitat variegation in highly fragmented sites is an effective strategy to prevent or buffer homogenization processes in the REBISO landscape.},

	abstract = {Land-use change is considered the greatest threat to biodiversity worldwide. As such, identifying the drivers that shape biological communities is crucial for enhancing conservation strategies in human-modified tropical landscapes. We used a hybrid patch-landscape design and a multi model inference approach to assess the relative impacts of forest loss, increased edge density and increased pasture cover on dung beetle functional groups in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest - a biodiversity hotspot. Our findings provide novel empirical evidence showing that edge density can be a major driver for dung beetles when compared to forest and pasture cover at the landscape scale. However, forest and pasture cover also influenced some dung beetle responses, supporting the idea that biological communities are negatively affected by habitat loss and changes in land cover. We found that dung beetle body size, protibia area and metatibia length were all larger in landscapes with increased edge density, reinforcing the need for further studies exploring which mechanisms could favour the presence of larger dung beetles in fragmented tropical landscapes. Taken together, these results suggest the need of conservation and management strategies focused on the protection of the remaining Atlantic Forest fragments, and the promotion of forest recovery and reduction in the pasture cover and edge density at the landscape-level.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests, which harbor high levels of biodiversity, are being lost at an alarming speed. Madagascar, a biodiversity hotspot, has lost more than half of its original forest cover. Most of the remaining forests are small fragments of primary and secondary forest with differing degrees of human impact. These forests, as well as coffee and fruit plantations, may be important in supporting the forest-dependent biodiversity in Madagascar but this has been little studied. In Madagascar, dung beetles, which offer important ecosystem services, are largely restricted to forests. We examined the ability of fragmented and degraded forests to support dung beetle diversity, compared to the large areas of primary forest in eastern Madagascar. We found a general trend of a reduction of species with a loss of forest connectivity. In contrast, a higher level of forest disturbance was associated with higher species diversity. In several sites of low-quality forest as many or more species were found as in less disturbed and primary forests. The average size of dung beetles was smaller in the lower quality localities than in the primary forests. These findings suggest that many forest dung beetles in Madagascar are better adapted to forest disturbance than earlier expected, although they require some level of connectivity to surrounding forest. in Malagasy is available with online material.},

	abstract = {Dung beetles present a high specificity degree to certain habitat types and they are widely used as bioindicators of environmental changes. Pitfall traps usually baited with human feces are the main method for collecting these insects. However, despite dung beetles being good flyers and actively move in the environment, collections with flight intercept traps have been little used in inventories of these insects in the wild. The fact that the intercept trap usually does not use any attractants, randomly capturing individuals can minimize sampling artifacts related with bait, light or other attractive methods. Here, we use flight intercept traps to analyze the dung beetle assemblages in different habitats in the Amazon rainforest. Dung beetles were sampled weekly from March 2017 to February 2018 in an Amazon forest fragment under anthropic pressure, cupuacu orchard, and exotic pasture in Porto Velho, Rondonia, Brazil. A total of 1041 individuals belonging to 35 species of dung beetles were collected. The species accumulation curve showed no significant difference in the number of species among the three different habitats. The dung beetle species composition found in the forest fragment and cupuacu orchard was similar, but the community of these two habitats was different from the exotic pasture. Our study provides a list of dung beetle species sampled using a method that is still little used in ecological studies using dung beetles as a study model. Finally, the flight intercept trap is a useful tool for dung beetle inventories in different habitats in the Amazon rainforest.},

	abstract = {1. Urbanisation causes important losses in biodiversity and ecosystem of animals. To test whether these negative effects are preceded by unhealthy individuals in urban populations, we evaluated the effects of urbanisation on the abundance and physical condition of the dung beetle Dichotomius guaribensis, an endemic species of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. 2. We sampled beetles in nine forest fragments with different urbanisation degrees, embedded in the urban matrix of the city of Joao Pessoa. Besides testing the abundance in each fragment, we quantified four indicators of physical condition in males and females: body size, body mass, energetic condition, and mite load. 3. Females tended to be larger, and to have less lipid mass and more mites than males. Urbanisation had no effect on beetle abundance, but it negatively affected body mass and lipid content in males, but not females, revealing different sensitivities for both sexes. Body size and mite load were not affected by urbanisation in males or females. Fragment size had no effect on beetle abundance and physical condition in both sexes, suggesting that urbanisation has a greater impact than fragment size on beetle individual condition. 4. In this study, we show that individual deterioration precedes population declines in disturbed environments, and our study opens new insights into the proximate causes that leads to the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in urbanised regions.},

	abstract = {The creation of mega-hydropower dams inundates vast lowland areas, causing widespread environmental impacts in tropical forest regions. Few studies, however, have taken advantage of these newly fragmented landscapes to examine the effects of habitat insularization on arthropod faunas. Here, we assess how dung beetle assemblages respond to 30 years of post-isolation history in forest islands within a major hydroelectric reservoir in Central Amazonia. We sampled 30 of the 3546 islands created by this reservoir, and three neighbouring forest sites. We collected a total of 865 individuals representing 34 dung beetle species and 15 genera. Remarkably, one third of all islands had been entirely defaunated of dung beetles in terms of overall occupancy. Isolation was the single best predictor of dung beetle species richness, followed by the interaction between isolation and island area, and these variables were key determinants of the relict species composition. Isolation was the most important predictor of dung beetle abundance, but area alone was the main predictor of abundance when the dominant species was excluded. We predicted species richness across all 3546 islands, indicating that 61.5\% of all islands likely retain only a single `super-tramp' species (Onthophagus osculatii). These community disassembly patterns were likely aggravated by the marked hostility of the open-water matrix combined with the poor flight dispersal capacity of dung beetles over wide gaps between insular forests. As such, the overwhelming number of small, isolated islands created by major dams has profound effects on regional forest biodiversity, including wholesale local extinctions in detritivore assemblages and their ecosystem functions.},

During this time of biodiversity loss around the world, bioinventories of ecologically important habitats serve as important indicators for the effectiveness of conservation efforts. We conducted a bioinventory of the foliar, soil, and dung arthropod communities in 10 cattle pastures located in the southeastern United States during the 2018 grazing season. In sum, 126,251 arthropod specimens were collected. From the foliar community, 13 arthropod orders were observed, with the greatest species richness found in Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Hemiptera. The soil-dwelling arthropod community contained 18 orders. The three orders comprising the highest species richness were Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera. Lastly, 12 arthropod orders were collected from cattle dung, with the greatest species richness found in Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera. Herbivores were the most abundant functional guild found in the foliar community, and predators were most abundant in the soil and dung communities. Arthropod pests constituted a small portion of the pasture arthropod communities, with 1.01\%, 0.34\%, and 0.46\% pests found in the foliar, soil, and dung communities, respectively. While bioinventories demand considerable time, energy, and resources to accomplish, the information from these inventories has many uses for conservation efforts, land management recommendations, and the direction of climate change science.},

We examined the impacts of the tunneling beetle, Onthophagus taurus (Schreber), and the dwelling beetle, Labarrus pseudolividus (Balthasar), on the carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emitted from pasture-laid bovine dung as well as their sum-total (CO2 + CH4 + N2O) effect on global warming, or their carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e). Despite dung beetles potential effects on CH4 and N2O, the existing literature shows no ultimate CO(2)e reductions. We hypothesized that more dung beetles would degrade pats faster and reduce CO(2)e, and so we increased the average dung beetle biomass per dung volume 6.22x above previously published records, and visually documented any dung damage. However, the time effects were 2-5x greater for any GHG and CO(2)e (E = 0.27-0.77) than dung beetle effects alone (E = 0.09-0.24). This suggests that dung beetle communities cannot adequately reduce GHGs unless they can accelerate dung decomposition faster than time alone.},

Here, we evaluated how the type of diet can influence the attractiveness of omnivorous-mammal feces to Amazonian dung beetles. We sampled dung beetles in 10 fragments of Amazon rainforest in July 2018 (dry season) and March 2019 (rainy season), using pitfall traps baited with swill pig dung (household waste-based diet), grain pig dung (maize+soybean-based diet), and human feces (control) in Juina, Mato Grosso, Brazil. In all, 2,080 individuals from 51 species of dung beetles were collected. Between the pig dung evaluated, higher total abundance and species richness was captured with grain pig dung. However, the species composition and community structure were similar between pig dung types. Additionally, grain pig dung captured total species richness, species composition, and structure similar to that for human feces.Thus, although grain pig dung did not sample total abundance similar to human feces, this type of dung can be efficient for an accurate survey of the total species richness, species composition, and structure of dung beetles in the Amazon rainforest.},

	abstract = {Dung beetles are frequently used to assess tropical biodiversity patterns and recovery in human-modified forests. We conducted a comprehensive dung beetle survey (coprophagous and necrophagous communities) within five habitat types, across a land-use gradient, in the ecologically biodiverse Osa Peninsula, located in Costa Rica's south Pacific. In addition to assessing species richness, abundance, and biomass, we also assessed community level traits and species-specific responses using a generalised joint attribute modelling approach. We found that under favourable conditions (40-50 years of regeneration, close proximity to contiguous old-growth forest and control of poaching), secondary rainforest recovered similar levels of species richness, and key traits of old-growth forest dung beetle communities. However, at the community-level, dung beetle abundance, richness, biomass, and diversity varied between habitat types of different anthropogenic disturbance and land-use. Generally, the carrion beetle community did not recover as well as the dung beetle community and the abundance of dung beetles was a third lower in naturally regenerating secondary forest compared with old growth. Regenerating secondary growth and plantation forests showed community compositions similar to old growth forests, while open and fragmented habitats had degraded and impoverished levels of dung beetle biodiversity. Overall, the levels of dung-beetle biodiversity detected are encouraging for naturally regenerating secondary forest, suggesting a high potential value of these areas to buffer the pressure of deforestation and habitat alteration on remaining old-growth tropical forests.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112009},
	abstract = {Meeting rising demand for oil palm whilst minimizing the loss of tropical biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions is a core conservation challenge. One potential solution is focusing the expansion of high-yielding crops on presently low-yielding farmlands alongside protecting nearby tropical forests that can enhance provision of ecosystem functions. A key question is how this solution would impact invertebrate functional diversity. We focus on oil palm in the Colombian Llanos, where plantations are replacing improved cattle pastures and forest fragments, and on dung beetles, which play key functional roles in nutrient cycling and secondary seed dispersal. We show that functional richness and functional diversity of dung beetles is greater in oil palm than in cattle pasture, and that functional metrics did not differ between oil palm and remnant forest. The abundance-size class profile of dung beetles in oil palm was more similar to forest than to pasture, which had lower abundances of the smallest and largest dung beetles. The abundance of tunneling and rolling dung beetles did not differ between oil palm and forest, while higher forest cover increased the abundance of diurnal and generalist-feeding beetles in oil palm landscapes. This suggests that prioritizing agricultural development on low-yielding cattle pasture will have positive effects on functional diversity and highlights the need for forest protection to maintain ecosystem functioning within agricultural landscapes.},

	abstract = {Great losses of biodiversity in natural ecosystems are occurring as a result of growing anthropic threats. A better understanding of the contributions of spatial scales to biodiversity organization would allow improved spatial management to conserve biodiversity in those regions that are strongly impacted by anthropic activities, such the Brazilian Cerrado. The aim of this study was to evaluate how dung beetle diversity is spatially organized along the cerrado sensu stricto, a common savanna formation in central Brazil. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) dung beetle diversity shows nonrandom patterns that vary between spatial scales within the same phytophysionomy, and (2) different functional groups and the abundant and rare species display distinct and nonrandom spatial patterns of diversity along spatial scales due to different life histories. We collected dung beetles in eight areas of cerrado sensu stricto distributed in two fragments and analyzed the spatial organization of dung beetle diversity using additive diversity partitioning. A total of 6130 individuals and 54 species were collected. Additive partitioning of diversity showed a prominent importance of the scale of areas in the organization of diversity, demonstrating a stronger influence of local factors on this organization. Assemblages divided into functional groups showed differential contributions of diversity components, indicating distinct habitat influences on these groups. This work provides new insights into the spatial organization of dung beetle diversity, encompassing three spatial levels for the same phytophysionomy in the Brazilian Cerrado. These findings demonstrate the importance of maintaining spatial heterogeneity of habitats. Thus, multiple localities within a region must be preserved because of their unique diversity structuring.},

	doi = {10.1111/1365-2664.13784},
	abstract = {There is growing interest in the ecological value of set-aside habitats around rivers in tropical agriculture. These riparian buffers typically comprise forest or other non-production habitat, and are established to maintain water quality and hydrological processes, while also supporting biodiversity, ecosystem function and landscape connectivity. We investigated the capacity for riparian buffers to act as microclimatic refugia by combining field-based measurements of temperature, humidity and dung beetle communities with remotely sensed data from LiDAR across an oil palm dominated landscape in Borneo. Riparian buffers offer a cool and humid habitat relative to surrounding oil palm plantations, with wider buffers characterised by conditions comparable to riparian sites in continuous logged forest. High vegetation quality and topographic sheltering were strongly associated with cooler and more humid microclimates in riparian habitats across the landscape. Variance in beetle diversity was also predicted by both proximity-to-edge and microclimatic conditions within the buffer, suggesting that narrow buffers amplify the negative impacts that high temperatures have on biodiversity. Synthesis and applications. Widely legislated riparian buffer widths of 20-30 m each side of a river may provide drier and less humid microclimatic conditions than continuous forest. Adopting wider buffers and maintaining high vegetation quality will ensure set-asides established for hydrological reasons bring co-benefits for terrestrial biodiversity, both now, and in the face of anthropogenic climate change.},

	abstract = {Although dung beetles are important members of ecological communities and indicators of ecosystem quality, species diversity, and how it varies over space and habitat types, remains poorly understood in the Brazilian Cerrado. We compared dung beetle communities among plant formations in the Serra Azul State Park (SASP) in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Sampling (by baited pitfall and flight-interception traps) was carried out in 2012 in the Park in four habitat types: two different savanna formations (typical and open) and two forest formations (seasonally deciduous and gallery). A total of 5,400 individuals collected comprised 57 species in 22 genera. Typical savanna had the greatest species richness and abundance, followed by open savanna and deciduous forest, while the gallery forest had the fewest species but high abundance. Tunnelers (one of three main nesting behavior guilds) showed the greatest richness and abundance (except in the gallery forest, where one dweller species was extremely abundant) in all plant formations. We found that species richness and abundance of the dung beetle community are influenced by differences among plant formations. Habitat heterogeneity in the different plant formations along with anthropic influences (fire, habitat fragmentation) are cited as important factors that explain guild and species richness and distribution patterns. These results emphasize the importance of protected areas, such as SASP, for the maintenance and conservation of species diversity in the Brazilian Cerrado.},

	abstract = {Human population growth and the activities resulting in habitat destruction are a threat to biodiversity worldwide. Despite the recognized importance of dung beetles in supporting tropical forest ecosystems, our understanding of their susceptibility to anthropogenic pressures remains limited. Previous research detailed the overall consequences of habitat loss driven by human activities to tropical dung beetle assemblages and traits. The work pointed out main knowledge gaps and outlined future work inspiring a surge in research. After a decade, we build upon the previous review, and bring an update to this topic with the aim of disentangling the confounding drivers impacting dung beetle responses. Using a comprehensive meta-analytical approach, we address the main geographical constraints and limitations, summarize the most up-to-date information, and draw new conclusions on the consequences of human activities to dung beetles. Our results help to draw together the patterns defining how human activities alter dung beetle abundance, species richness, community diversity and evenness. We show that beetle assemblage composition depends upon the origin and intensity of forest conversion, and has consequences for dung beetle associated ecosystem functions. Finally, we demonstrate that the depletion of large vertebrates throughout the tropics has indirect effects on beetle communities. As a consequence, anthropogenic actions are likely to harm dung beetle populations both directly, through habitat loss, and indirectly, through the cascading effects of the loss of large mammals.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss and degradation are the most widely cited drivers of changes in species abundance and diversity. We explored changes in dung beetle species diversity and composition across different land uses in the north west Tanzanian savannah. We expected a negative response gradient in the diversity and composition of the dung beetle community, from land uses that preserve vegetation and hold native mammal diversity to livestock intensive and heavily grazed areas. Dung beetles were sampled in a protected area and two anthropogenically influenced land use types. Species richness and composition of each land use type, including differences in diversity and functional groups were analyzed and indicator species for each land use gradient were identified. As expected, diversity and community composition varied between areas with less environmental change compared to those impacted anthropogenically. We conclude that conservation of protected areas within African savannahs can provide a functionally rich dung beetle community and subsequently rich ecological functions. The dung beetle species identified by this study as eco-indicators can be used as a benchmark for future studies that use rapid monitoring to assess disturbance in African savannas.},

	abstract = {Forestry companies have replaced and fragmented the native landscapes, generating a large number of unpaved roads, which can have a negative effect on non-flying invertebrates. Polynoncus bullatus is a common necrophagous beetle species depend on fox scats present on unpaved roads in fragmented landscapes in central Chile. Here, the effect of different habitat types (native forest, clear-cuts and unpaved roads) on the abundance of Lycalopex culpaeus scats as well as abundance and survival of P. bullatus in the fragmented landscape was evaluated. Scats and beetles were counted in seven independent fragments during 6 months and through sampling transects. Both responses and factors were associated with GLM, whereas survival was evaluated with a Kaplan-Meier test. Higher scats abundance was found on unpaved roads than other habitat types. Higher P. bullatus abundance was also significantly associated with unpaved roads than clear-cuts and native forest fragments. An additive model between habitat type and scat abundance was correlated with beetle abundance. Survival was significantly lower in unpaved roads, generating up to 42 \% of beetles road-killed. Lycalopex culpaeus response positively to fragmentation defecating more on unpaved roads because foxes use it to move through the landscape. This fact attracts more P. bullatus individuals, being run-over by cars and trucks, representing an ecological trap for beetles. This interaction can be predictable and modeled for any period, length or road type avoiding potential massive road-kill events. Implications for insect conservation. Common and threatened invertebrate species are run-over when minor roads cross valuable natural or protected areas, evidencing the need of advance in road designs compatible with their conservation and mitigating negative impacts of forestry.},

	abstract = {We evaluated how the taxonomic and functional diversity of dung beetles responds to landscape fragmentation in Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve (LTBR). We sampled dung beetle assemblages in 15 landscapes (spatial windows) representing a gradient of forest cover loss and evaluated the degree of forest fragmentation in each landscape. The percentage of forest coverage of each landscape had a significant positive effect on species richness (0D), Shannon diversity (1D), and functional divergence of dung beetles. Forest fragmentation was negatively related to Simpson diversity (2D), biomass, and functional evenness of dung beetles, whereas their functional richness expanded as forest fragmentation increased. Taxonomic and functional beta diversity were positively correlated; the former was driven mainly by species replacement and the latter by nestedness. Functional alpha and beta diversities varied mostly at random, as did the probability of co-occurrence between species. However, the few non-random positive associations between species involved small-bodied forest dung beetles. Species and their ecological traits are lost randomly in the landscape, suggesting a surprising resilience of dung beetle assemblages to forest cover loss. Nevertheless, loss and fragmentation of forest coverage had an unbalancing effect on dung beetle abundance and trait distribution, reducing their functional evenness, and divergence while favoring the establishment of small-sized species. In conclusion, although the LTBR has buffered further loss of dung beetle species and functional richness, it cannot effectively safeguard all aspects of their functional diversity. Our results suggest that the recovery of the original forest cover and large mammals is crucial for maintaining the taxonomic and functional diversity of dung beetles in tropical rainforests.},

	abstract = {Nestedness is widely observed in natural metacommunities, but its underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. The distribution of habitats in the landscape and differences in dispersal rates of distinct insect taxa can determine the nestedness of the metacommunity. Here, we evaluated how species habitat specialization contributes to metacommunity nestedness in insect groups with different dispersal capacities in a mountaintop landscape in south-eastern Brazil. We sampled ants, butterflies and dung beetles in two main habitats, naturally fragmented forest islands and a grassland matrix (campo rupestre), during both dry and rainy seasons. We classified species according to their degree of habitat specialization (generalists or specialists) based on the relative frequencies and abundances between these two contrasting habitats. Forty of 211 species were classified as habitat specialists, seven as habitat generalists. It was not possible to classify the remaining species. The metacommunity was nested in structure, with habitat generalist species contributing more to nestedness than habitat specialists. Nonetheless, habitat distribution in the landscape did not affect the nestedness of the metacommunity. Our findings reveal that species sorting (for habitat specialists) and mass effects (for habitat generalists) are concurrent processes in the mountaintop forest-grassland mosaic. Our study helps to advance our understanding of the differences in the distribution of generalist and specialist species in a tropical mountaintop landscape and improves our ability to predict and manage the increasingly adverse effects of changes in land use and climate on metacommunities and ecosystem functions.},

	abstract = {Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are one of the most threatened ecosystems worldwide. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of TDFs in South America: the Amazonian TDF hypothesis and the Pleistocene Arc hypothesis (PAH). There is a need to evaluate the distribution patterns of different organisms across the TDF distribution. We tested the following hypotheses: the species composition is determined by historical-evolutionary events, and therefore, the TDFs have a similar species composition as predicted by the PAH. Alternatively, the species composition is determined by recent ecological processes, and therefore, the TDFs have a sharing of species to their respective adjacent dominant habitat, with no support for the PAH. We expect that climatic factors drive the species richness, abundance and species dissimilarity (beta-diversity) between TDFs and adjacent habitats across the latitudinal gradient. We sampled dung beetles across six Brazilian states in TDF fragments and adjacent dominant habitats and obtained the climatic conditions across the gradient. We used the beta-diversity partition and generalised linear models to test our hypotheses. We sampled 8,625 dung beetles representing 102 species. Sorensen dissimilarity was higher among TDFs than between TDFs and adjacent habitats and was mostly due to the substitution of species. Annual mean temperature had a positive effect on abundance in TDFs but did not affect species richness. Species substitution (Podani's approach) between TDFs and adjacent habitats decreased with mean diurnal range of temperature, while nestedness patterns (Baselga's approach) increased with annual precipitation. Depending on the approach used (Baselga's vs. Podani's), we can obtain different results across the latitudinal gradient. The composition and structure of dung beetle assemblages in TDFs are mostly determined by more recent regional-to-local ecological processes since each TDF has a unique evolutionary history and a different dung beetle species composition. Our results do not support the Pleistocene Arc hypothesis. Abstract in portuguese is available with online material},

	abstract = {Roller dung beetles play a pivotal role in the nutrient distribution in soil and secondary dispersal of seeds. Dung beetles are sampled either using a dung-baited pitfall trap or an exposed dung pile on the ground. While the former method is useful for a rapid survey of dung beetles, information on the ecology and behaviour of dung beetles can be lost, which the latter method provides, but underestimates species diversity due to its inefficiency in trapping rollers. Efficiency of a new method for sampling rollers-installing guarding pitfall traps around dung piles-is assessed in three habitats-contiguous tropical rainforests, fragmented forests, and disturbed used home gardens-and two diel periods-day and night. Five guarding pitfall traps were installed at 50 cm radius around dung piles. About 98\% of the total rollers were sampled in pitfall traps. The habitats were similar when the roller catches of only dung piles-conventional approach-were analyzed, but were different when the rollers of guarding pitfall traps were considered. The roller abundance was negatively affected by forest fragmentation and land-use change. About 98\% of the rollers were collected at daytime. Using guarding pitfall traps around dung piles is highly recommended for dung beetle diversity studies.},

	abstract = {Baited pitfall traps (BPTs) and flight intercept traps (FITs) are the most common methods employed for sampling dung beetle communities. These methods vary in their efficacy and are affected by factors such as the bait types used and the dispersal abilities of different dung beetle species. We present the first quantitative comparison of the community composition, taxonomic and functional diversity of dung beetles caught in human dung BPTs and FITs in Bornean tropical forests. Functional diversity metrics were calculated based on the three functional traits of nesting method, body length, and diel activity. We show that BPTs and FITs captured complementary communities with different functional traits, and that BPTs captured more functionally diverse communities. We therefore recommend using a combination of both BPTs and FITs for studies assessing the composition of dung beetles across habitat types. Our results also highlight that it is important to consider how trap type affects the trait composition of communities when relating dung beetle communities and functional traits to ecological functioning. We suggest modifications to FITs based on the design of harp traps to increase their effectiveness in capturing larger-bodied beetles.},

We assessed how habitat type and local environmental conditions determine the distribution of individuals of Canthon cyanellus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), an eurytopic dung beetle, according to age category and sexual gonadic maturity. Beetles were surveyed in forest fragments, live fences, and pastures in Mexico. Individuals were categorised into six age categories according to the glandular volumes in males and oocyte number and length in females. Mature females in forest fragments were the most abundant females found among the habitats. Air humidity and soil hardness were positively and negatively related to mature female abundance, respectively. Mature beetles were the most abundant among males, and higher abundance of males occurred in forest fragments than in live fences and pastures. Light quantity was negatively related to the abundance of young males. Compared to forest fragments, females in pastures had larger oocytes. However, sites with higher soil hardness and air humidity had females with lower numbers of oocytes. Our results demonstrate that, although C. cyanellus occurs across a wide range of habitats, forest habitats might host sexually mature individuals, which translates into more effective individual dispersion and potential reproduction.},

	abstract = {1. Soil infiltration capacity determines the partitioning of precipitation into infiltration and overland flow and is therefore an important soil hydrological characteristic. Water infiltration through soil is facilitated by macropores created by roots and soil macrofauna. In clay-rich soils, such as those of the tropical forests of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, most infiltration occurs via these preferential flow pathways. 2. We evaluated the effects of dung beetle tunnelling on infiltration and macropore creation (depth and width of the flow pathways) in tropical forest soils in Sabah. Using mesocosms, we applied three treatments (i) soil-only, (ii) dung-only, (iii) dung + dung beetles, and measured saturated hydraulic conductivity (i.e., the steady-state infiltration rate) after 0, 5 and 10 days, and assessed depth and width of infiltration pathways by applying a blue dye tracer. 3. The steady-state infiltration rate increased in the presence of dung beetles, though differences among treatments were only statistically significant after 10 days. After 5 days of dung beetle presence, infiltrated water had reached a greater depth than the control mesocosms without beetles. However, there were no differences in the width of infiltration pathways among treatments. 4. These results reveal the important, but under studied roles of dung beetles on soil hydrological functioning, that may have consequences for nutrient cycling and plant productivity. Further, our findings indicate that the novel application of an established hydrological method-blue dye tracer-can provide interesting and reliable results for macrofauna-soil interaction studies.},

	abstract = {Fragmentation of tropical forests is increasing globally, with negative impacts for biodiversity. In Southeast Asia, expansion of oil palm agriculture has caused widespread deforestation, forest degradation and fragmentation. Persistence of forest-dependent species within these fragmented landscapes is likely to depend on the capacity of individuals to move between forest patches. In oil palm landscapes, riparian buffers along streams and rivers are potential movement corridors, but their use by moving animals is poorly studied. We examined how six dung beetle species traversed riparian buffers connected to a continuous forest reserve area within an oil palm plantation in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We used a mark-release-recapture study and a new Bayesian Joint Species Movement Modelling (JSMM) approach, extended to a continuous capture process model. Dung beetle species were fairly generalist in their habitat use, but two species showed a statistically supported preference for riparian buffer forest over oil palm, and one species showed a strong preference for forest reserve over riparian buffer, indicating the importance of forested areas within oil palm landscapes for some species. A land-use change simulation indicated that the loss of riparian buffers in oil palm will result in reduced movement by forest-dependent species. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide evidence for the use of riparian buffers in oil palm plantations for forest-dependent dung beetle species, strengthening the case for their retention, restoration and re-establishment. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the wider applicability of the Joint Species Movement Modelling (JSMM) framework to assess movement behaviour of species in fragmented landscapes, a vital tool for future forest and landscape management and conservation prioritisation exercises.},

	abstract = {Mountains present large climatic variations along elevational gradients, which can affect the distribution and abundance of species over space and time (e.g. reduction in richness towards higher elevations and seasonal variations). However, variations in biodiversity along elevational gradients within the Atlantic Forest - a hyperdiverse and highly threatened Neotropical biome - have been seldom studied. We characterize the elevational and temporal variation in species richness and abundance of Scarabaeinae dung beetles along the elevational gradient of the Itatiaia National Park. Surveys were carried out between 600 and 2400 m a.s.l., with 3 pitfall traps installed every 50 m of elevation, constituting the largest elevational range studied so far for Brazilian dung beetles. We found a total of 3,586 individuals from 53 species of Scarabaeinae, mostly paracoprids. Species richness and abundance were higher at intermediate elevations (1000-1500 m). Dung beetle communities showed a marked seasonality, with 31 species exclusive of summer and only two in winter. Winter populations were also less abundant, showing a bimodal pattern of distribution of species abundances that contrasts with the lognormal pattern observed in the summer. We showed that both elevation and season correlate with species richness and abundance. Further, eight out of the nine species with large populations showed significant shifts in their elevational distributions between winter and summer. Our results indicate that Itatiaia hosts an extremely rich fauna of Scarabaeinae, with large variations in richness and abundance along the elevational gradient and significant phenological changes at the community level associated with climatic variations between seasons.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Dung beetles perform important functions in terrestrial ecosystems, but anthropic pressures affect them negatively. These effects are well documented in neotropical lowland forests but have been studied little in Andean forests. Objective: To evaluate how the attributes of the dung beetle assemblages and three of their ecological functions differ in three types of vegetation cover, and to determine the relationships between attributes and functions, and among functions. Methods: Dung beetles were captured with pitfall traps, and ecological functions were measured through a field experiment in the farm “El Ocaso” (Colombia), in three types of vegetation cover: secondary forest, mixed forest and cattle pasture (three independent sites per cover). The assemblage attributes that were evaluated were abundance, number of species, biomass, and weighted mean body length; functions measured were dung removal, soil excavation, and secondary seed dispersal. Results: It was found that both the assemblage attributes and the ecological functions were negatively affected in the more disturbed vegetation covers, particularly in cattle pastures. Most of the assemblage attributes correlated positively with functions; soil excavation and secondary seed dispersal had a strong positive correlation with dung removal. Conclusions: Dung beetle assemblages play important ecological functions and they are sensitive to ecosystem disturbances. This study shows how dung beetles and their functions are affected negatively when forest is trans-formed to cattle pasture in the understudied and highly fragmented Andean forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The loss of larger frugivores alters seed dispersal. Species reintroductions have been proposed as a strategy for reversing local disperser extinctions. However, their effects on ecological processes have seldom been assessed. Howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba) have been reintroduced in Tijuca National Park, a defaunated Atlantic Forest fragment. We compared the fate of seeds dispersed by howlers to dispersal by two other frugivores present in the park: capuchin monkeys (Sapajus nigritus) and guans (Penelope superciliaris). Howlers produce clumped defecations that attract dung beetles, which provide secondary dispersal by burying seeds embedded in feces. We expected that seeds dispersed by howlers would have a different fate from those dispersed by capuchins and guans, since their scattered defecations are less attractive to dung beetles. We followed the fate of seeds 3-14 mm in diameter through three processes after seed deposition: secondary dispersal, predation, and seedling emergence. We estimated the probabilities in each step according to the primary disperser and plant species. Dispersal by howlers increased the recruitment of large-seeded plants because of the higher probability of secondary dispersal of the seeds in their feces. Fewer of the seeds dispersed by capuchins or guans were buried, regardless of size, and burial depths were shallower. For 3 mm seeds, the final recruitment probability was similar across frugivores. However, more of the larger seeds reached the seedling stage when dispersed by howlers since they were buried more deeply, which increased their survival without affecting seedling emergence. Reintroductions can thus contribute to restoring ecological processes.},

	abstract = {Temperature change is an often-assumed, but rarely tested, mechanism by which sensitive species may decline in forest landscapes following habitat degradation, fragmentation and destruction. Traits mediate how species respond to environmental change, with physiological, morphological and behavioural traits key to determining the response of ectotherms to temperature. We collected data on traits linked to thermal sensitivity (critical thermal maxima, body size, cuticle lightness and pilosity) for 46 dung beetle species (Scarabaeinae) in a forest-oil palm mosaic in Malaysian Borneo. By combining these data with a large-scale community sampling campaign (¿59,000 individuals sampled from ¿600 traps) and an airborne Light Detection and Ranging-derived thermal map, we investigated how traits mediate species- and community-level responses to temperature. Using hierarchical models, we found that critical thermal maxima predicted how species respond to maximum temperatures. These results were mirrored in community-level analyses alongside similar patterns in other thermal traits. Increased body size and decreased pilosity were associated with higher temperatures, while cuticle lightness showed a complex relationship with temperature across the disturbance gradient. Our findings highlight the potential mechanisms by whichforest specialists decline in human-modified landscapes, resulting in changes to community patterns and processes.

	abstract = {Introduction: Typically, research on dung beetles in the Tropical Dry Forests (TDF) of Colombian Caribbean region, have applied methodologies designed for wet or Andean areas of the country, which could be influencing the performance and efficiency of sampling. Objective: In order to contribute to this discussion, we analyzed how the bait amount and pitfall trap operating time influence the collection effectiveness of dung beetles in a TDF fragment at Reserva Campesina La Flecha, San Jacinto, Colombia. Methods: For the collection of beetles, we utilized pitfall traps baited with three different amounts of attractants: small (34.6 g), medium (53.8 g), and large (114.9 g), which remained active in the field for 48 h., 4 samplings between March and September 2015 were carried out, covering both, dry and rainy seasons. Results: A total of 4 563 individuals were recorded, grouped into 10 genera and 27 species of dung beetles. The highest values of richness, abundance and biomass were registered in the large bait, at 48 h, during the rainy season. However, the trap operating time had no effect on the estimation of beetles' richness, abundance, and biomass, regardless of bait sizes. The three diversity orders (D-0, D-1 y D-2) showed similar values between the bait amounts during rainy season, but in the dry season, the largest baits displayed the highest diversity values. On the other hand, with the largest bait, significantly more richness, abundance, and biomass of small and large body beetles were registered, especially during the dry season. Conclusions: The results of this research show that, for the study of beetles' assemblages in the BST, the use of a larger bait contributes to a better estimate of richness, abundance, diversity and biomass, especially during the dry season, when environmental conditions promote a more rapidly loss of baits attractiveness.},

	abstract = {Describing dung beetle communities in tropical forest remnants located in disturbed/urbanized and conserved areas can provide information about the functioning of these ecosystems and support conservation plans. This study aimed to verify the effect of seasons and bait type on dung beetle communities in remnants of the Atlantic Forest in order to describe their composition and diversity parameters. The study was carried out during both the rainy and dry seasons in periurban and urban remnants. Eighteen pitfall traps baited with feces, carrion, and injured millipedes were established in each site. A total of 3501 individuals and 23 species were recorded. Urban remnant presented higher abundance of individuals in the dry season. On the other hand, in periurban remnant the higher abundance was verified in the rainy season. The diversity was higher in the rainy season in both sites. In urban remnant, Coprophanaeus ensiferwas found to be generalist regarding its choice of bait (feces and carrion). The use of injured millipedes as bait allowed the record of the predatory species Deltochilum alpercata. Among the types of bait used, the injured millipedes proved to be very effective, capturing a greater diversity of dung beetles during the rainy season in both remnants, and allowed the collection of specialized, necrophages, and generalists species. Therefore, we propose the use of mixed-bait sampling designs in inventories and surveys to increase the chances of sampling species with different traits or dietary preferences, which are often rare in collections.},

	doi = {10.1111/1365-2656.13655},
	abstract = {Conservation outcomes could be greatly enhanced if strategies addressing anthropogenic land-use change considered the impacts of these changes on entire communities as well as on individual species. Examining how species interactions change across gradients of habitat disturbance allows us to predict the cascading consequences of species extinctions and the response of ecological networks to environmental change. We conducted the first detailed study of changes in a commensalist network of mammals and dung beetles across an environmental disturbance gradient, from primary tropical forest to plantations, which varied in above-ground carbon density (ACD) and mammal communities. Mammal diversity changed only slightly across the gradient, remaining high even in oil palm plantations and fragmented forest. Dung beetle species richness, however, declined in response to lower ACD and was particularly low in plantations and the most disturbed forest sites. Three of the five network metrics (nestedness, network specialization and functionality) were significantly affected by changes in dung beetle species richness and ACD, but mammal diversity was not an important predictor of network structure. Overall, the interaction networks remained structurally and functionally similar across the gradient, only becoming simplified (i.e. with fewer dung beetle species and fewer interactions) in the most disturbed sites. We suggest that the high diversity of mammals, even in disturbed forests, combined with the generalist feeding patterns of dung beetles, confer resilience to the commensalist dung beetle-mammal networks. This study highlights the importance of protecting logged and fragmented forests to maintain interaction networks and potentially prevent extinction cascades in human-modified systems.},

	abstract = {We assessed the effect of rangeland abandonment on dung beetle biodiversity and functional diversity in an African semi-desert region. Dung beetles were sampled on farms that were abandoned either over 10 years ago, abandoned one year ago, or not abandoned. We sampled from tree dominant landscape features including dry riverbeds, flatlands, and hills. We hypothesised that rangeland abandonment would decrease dung beetle biodiversity and functional diversity, also testing whether this pattern holds true across the dominant landscape features. Preference experiments revealed that all dung beetle species preferred dung resources other than sheep dung. Contrary to expectations, dung beetle biodiversity and functional richness was higher on abandoned rangelands. The landscape features that were particularly significant in sustaining high dung beetle diversity and functional diversity in this ecosystem were the flatlands and dry riverbeds, the main corridors of movement of animals. We speculate that rangeland abandonment improved conditions for most dung beetle species, due to decreased pressures on remaining native mammal populations. Despite this, larger species that need greater dung resources for development became rare after abandonment. Reintroductions of native mammals should therefore be encouraged to promote dung beetle biodiversity and functional diversity in this semi-desert ecosystem.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the diversity patterns of Scarabaeinae community along an altitudinal gradient under intense anthropogenic pressure in the central region of Chiapas, Mexico, considering the influence of environmental and landscape variables. We sampled dung beetles using baited pitfall traps in four sites located at different altitudes (870 m, 1120 m, 1620 m, 2370 m). We collected a total of 1,233 individuals belonging 32 species, 14 genera and seven tribes. Four species account 66.74\% of the total abundance, while another 20 are represented by a maximum of six individuals, including 10 singletons. Assemblages were more even at lower altitude sites and diversity was inversely related to increasing altitude. Similarity analysis indicated an evident segregation in species composition among the sites, forming three distinct dung beetle assemblages according to vegetation type. Within the gradient, we found 12 species with a strong association to the studied habitats. Redundancy analysis explained 41.3\% of the variation in the beetle community, the simplified model included the variables effective mesh size, altitude and canopy cover. These results suggest that fragmentation caused by human activities are leading to a biotic homogenization in dung beetle assemblages, with a high proportion of rare and opportunistic species. Nevertheless, this study contributes to the scarce knowledge regarding diversity of dung beetles that inhabits in altitudinal gradients in the Central region of Chiapas.},

	abstract = {Understanding how human-modified landscapes affect the phylogenetic composition and assembly mechanisms of biological communities is critical for effectively managing and restoring tropical ecosystems. We evaluated how forest coverage loss, fragmentation and landscape heterogeneity affect the phylogenetic diversity of dung beetles and their assembly mechanisms in Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, a protected but highly fragmented tropical landscape. We calculated Faith's phylogenetic diversity, mean pairwise phylogenetic distance and mean nearest taxon distance for 5,388 individuals in 36 species. The standardised effect sizes of these metrics were estimated to control their correlation with species richness. Phylogenetic diversity was also assessed separately for each dung beetle functional group. Finally, we compared the mean functional and phylogenetic pairwise distance and mean nearest taxon distance and measured the phylogenetic signal among dung beetle functional traits to determine the influence of niche conservatism on the phylogenetic structure of species assemblages. Faith's phylogenetic diversity of dung beetles was positively correlated with forest coverage, while their mean phylogenetic and nearest taxon distance values decreased with increasing landscape fragmentation. Necrophagous beetles and forest specialists responded most negatively to forest coverage loss and fragmentation. Alpha and beta diversity values showed phylogenetic overdispersion but functional convergence and weak phylogenetic signals in their functional traits, suggesting low niche conservatism. Landscapes with moderate forest coverage (¿= 40\%) favoured higher phylogenetic beta diversity, whereas phylogenetic and functional beta diversity decreased significantly in landscapes with low forest coverage (¡30\%). Synthesis and applications. Forest habitats in fragmented landscapes are essential for safeguarding the evolutionary history of dung beetles, reducing biotic homogenisation processes by favouring phylogenetic overdispersion and complementarity between sites. Therefore, to secure the phylogenetic diversity of dung beetles within fragmented tropical reserves, we recommend protecting the existing forests, preventing further fragmentation of continuous forest areas and increasing matrix quality by implementing biodiversity-friendly production systems. Finally, managers should consider assessing different functional groups in other species, as their response to landscape disturbance may not be phylogenetically similar. The above will allow more effective management practices to protect the species most susceptible to disturbances.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests worldwide have succumbed to rapid conversion into agricultural landscapes, but the local- and landscape-scale drivers of functional diversity and consequently ecosystem functioning remain poorly known, which limits management and conservation strategies. Here, we quantitatively assess how biofuel croplands affect taxonomic and functional diversity as well as trait-composition of dung beetle assemblages in a hyper-fragmented landscape of the Brazilian Atlantic forest dominated by sugarcane plantations. We also examine to what extent changes in patch attributes (patch scale forest loss), landscape composition (landscape scale forest loss) and landscape configuration (degree of fragmentation and forest edge density), induced by the establishment of sugarcane plantations, affect the functional reorganization of dung beetle assemblages. We estimated taxonomic and functional diversity (functional richness, evenness and redundancy) of dung beetle assemblages at 50 sampling sites across a sugarcane dominated hyper-fragmented landscape. In general, sugarcane plantations showed lower functional diversity than forest sites. Large-bodied coprophagous tunnelers were dominant across all forest sites, while small-bodied generalist-rollers were more abundant in sugarcane plantations. Functional evenness and dispersion were negatively affected by landscape composition, while landscape configuration and forest loss played a minor role. Our findings indicate that changes at both the patch and landscape scales induced by the establishment of sugarcane plantations exert strong impacts on the taxonomic and functional diversity of dung beetles. Implications for insect conservation These shifts in functional diversity can disrupt ecological functions served by these insects which, in turn, can accelerate the collapse of ecosystem functioning across tropical landscapes immersed in sugarcane plantations.},

	abstract = {Dung beetles perform essential ecological functions (e.g. nutrient cycling, secondary seed dispersal and parasite control) and are excellent indicators of ecosystem quality. However, in the Amazon region, the biodiversity of these insects is still poorly known. Here, we investigated the dung beetle biodiversity of the southwestern Brazilian Amazon and provide information on the distribution and natural history. We sampled dung beetles using pitfall traps baited with human feces in five forest fragments in municipality of Pimenta Bueno - Rondonia, Western Brazil. In all, 8502 individuals from 58 species of dung beetles were captured. In addition, four species were reported for the first time in the state of Rondonia: Canthon brunneus (Schmidt, 1922), Dendropaemon lydiae, Eurysternus howdeni and Eurysternus ventricosus Gill, 1990. Thirty species were classified as forest specialist, and seven as habitat generalists, suggesting an effect of the expansion of anthropic areas (e.g. introduced pastures) on the forest landscape. Thus, we highlight the need for monitoring the proportion between forest species and open-area species in the study region, in order to investigate a possible biotic homogenization process.},

	abstract = {Recent reviews of data on worldwide insect decline include almost no information on Brazil. We gathered evidence from literature searches and a survey sent to researchers, to which 96 replied and 56 provided information and publications. We present 75 instances of trends recorded over an average span of 11 years for aquatic and 22 years for terrestrial insects. These include time-replicated samples and expert opinion based on long-term local collections. Most terrestrial data are for butterflies, bees and scarab beetles. Aquatic studies include several insect orders, usually sorted to genus or family. Terrestrial insects showed significantly more cases of declines than increases, both in abundance (17 : 3) and in diversity (11 : 1). In aquatic cases, no tendency was detected in abundance (2 : 2) or diversity (3 : 4), not counting cases with no trend. Differences in these results among habitats may be due to the shorter span and less change in environmental conditions in the aquatic surveys, which included sites already degraded before sampling. We offer guidelines for future long-term assessments, including resampling of legacy collection sites.},

	abstract = {Habitat fragmentation changes biological communities and its spatiotemporal dynamics - which may lead to either biotic homogenization or heterogenization along time and space. Both processes can occur by addition, replacement or loss of species within communities, altering compositional similarity across the landscape. We investigated which of these two processes (biotic homogenization or heterogenization) occurs, and its possible underlying mechanism, over 15 years in an Atlantic Forest landscape using ants as model organisms. We sampled ants in 17 forest fragments across three different years, compared their composition similarity, species richness, and species richness of groups classified according to their habitat preferences. We sampled a total of 132 ant species. Ant communities in fragments diverged over time, suggesting they experienced an idiosyncratic structuring process. This biotic heterogenization occurred through an additive process, as ant species richness increased over time, mainly due to an increase of generalist ant species, and a decrease of forest specialist ant species. These changes occurred despite the higher forest cover in the landscape along years. Since different species can perform different functions in ecosystems, this biotic heterogenization may have implications for ecosystem functioning. Investigating how disturbances structure biological communities over time, especially those performing important ecosystem functions, can shed light to our understanding of possible changes in ecosystem functions and consequently for forest regeneration.},

The spatial distribution of species can be affected by vegetation structure and soil type at a small scale. Our study was conducted in a cattle ranch in which there were two grassland areas with different types of soil (humid silty clay vs. dry clay) and a plantation of Eucalyptus L'Her. (Myrtaceae). The aim of this study was to analyze variations in diversity and structure of dung beetle assemblages by considering the feeding guilds (coprophagous, necrophagous, and generalists) and functional groups (paracoprids, telecoprids, and non-nester dwellers) among the three mentioned habitats. Nine pitfall traps baited with cow dung. horse dung, or carrion were placed simultaneously at each site every two weeks over the course of a year. Coprophagous species dominated over necrophagous and generalist species in abundance and biomass in each habitat. The highest species richness occurred in the pasture on humid silty clay soil and the lowest in the Eucalyptus plantation. Abundance and biomass of paracoprids were highest in the pasture on humid silty clay soil, while non-nester dwellers dominated in the pasture on dry clay soil and the Eucalyptus plantation. Large paracoprids were almost non-existent in the pasture with dry clay soil. In the Eucalyptus plantation, the marked reduction in species richness, particularly of telecoprids and paracoprids. the increase in species dominance, and the absence of rare species were clear indicators of an adversely affected environment.},

	abstract = {The region of central Veracruz is considered a biodiversity hotspot due to its high species richness and environmental heterogeneity, but only 2\% of this region is currently protected. This study aimed to assess the current protected area system's effectiveness and to identify priority conservation areas for expanding the existing protected area system. We used the distribution models of 1186 species from three kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, and Fungi) together with ZONATION software, a conservation planning tool, to determine areas that could help expand the current network of protected areas. We applied three different parametrizations (including only species, using the boundary quality penalty, and using corridor connectivity). We found that protecting an additional 15\% of the area would increase, between 16.2\% and 19.3\%, the protection of the distribution area of all species. We propose that the regions with a consensus of the three parametrizations should be declared as new protected areas to expand 374 km(2) to the 216 km(2) already protected. Doing so would double the protected surface in central Veracruz. The priority areas identified in this study have more species richness, carbon stock values, natural vegetation cover, and less human impact index than the existing protected areas. If our identified priority areas are declared protected, we could expect a future recovery of endangered species populations for Veracruz. The proposed new protected areas are planned and designed as corridors connecting currently isolated protected areas to promote biodiversity protection.},

Although their role as lignocellulose decomposers is the focus of studies, they also act as dung recyclers, but their importance in this process is poorly understood. Here we performed manipulation experiments to determine dung removal by termites in forest remnants and cattle pastures in a fragmented Atlantic Forest landscape. We used wire bags of different mesh sizes placed along transects in three forest fragments and pastures for 10 days to compare the contribution of termites and other coprophagous macrodetritivores to dung removal. Our results indicated that termites removed more dung in pastures than in the forest fragments. In addition, dung beetle exclusion significantly reduced the percentage of dung removal within forest fragments, but not on pastures, indicating termites are important dung recyclers in pastures.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.actao.2022.103872},
	abstract = {The disappearance of large seed dispersers such as primates increases the dependence of endozoochorous plants bearing large fruits on frugivorous mesocarnivores for seed dispersal. Ecosystems in northern Japan are typical examples wherein the distribution and abundance of large-sized dispersers (i.e., Macaca fuscata and Ursus thi-betanus) have been constrained mainly owing to past anthropogenic disturbances. Moreover, the distribution of several native mesocarnivores has been fragmented, although masked palm civet, Paguma larvata, a non-native frugivorous mesocarnivore, has expanded its distribution over the past quarter-century. Here, we evaluated the roles of this non-native species in defaunated cool-temperate forests by assessing primary and secondary seed dispersal via civets. To assess the primary dispersal process, we identified their possible latrines, where seeds were initially dispersed, by tracking radio-tagged civets. We then compiled an inventory of seeds transported by civets combining the results of the fecal analysis performed in this study and a literature survey for seeds known to be transported by civets. To explore secondary seed dispersals, we first determined the ability of civet feces to attract dung beetles using pitfall traps and then compared this ability of civet feces with that of the feces of raccoon dog, Nyctereutes procyonoides, a native mesocarnivore. Our findings showed that (1) over 90\% of the civet latrines confirmed within forested areas with flat terrain, safe sites for germination and establishment of common plant seeds, and carried seeds of 20 plant species; (2) the civet feces were more strongly preferred by dung beetles than raccoon dog feces; and (3) the abundance of large tunneler beetles with superior seed burial ability using the civet feces was 3.7 times as high as that of raccoon dog feces. Thus, these findings suggest that this non-native mesocarnivore could recover functional redundancy by offsetting injured endozoochorous processes.},

	abstract = {Agricultural expansion is the primary driver of ecological degradation across the tropics. Set-asides-uncultivated parts of agricultural landscapes, often on steep slopes and alongside rivers-may alleviate environmental impacts but can reduce the area cultivated. Here we model an approach to configuring set-asides aimed at optimizing ecological outcomes (biodiversity, above-ground carbon storage and nutrient cycling) without reducing net cultivation area. We compare set-asides in an oil palm landscape where all plantations adopt the same configuration ('uniform' approach) with a scenario where there can be variation in configuration among plantations ('variable' approach). We find that all set-aside configurations support substantial ecological values but that the best strategies involve set-asides, particularly alongside rivers, that are spatially targeted and variable among plantations. This `variable' approach can increase ecological outcomes twofold over the `uniform' approach without reducing net cultivation area. Our findings underscore the potential importance of well-planned set-asides for enhancing agricultural sustainability. Agriculture is the largest threat to tropical ecosystems. This study finds that setting aside land for nature in targeted fashion, especially alongside rivers, can increase biodiversity and ecosystem services without reducing the net area cultivated.},

	abstract = {1. Entomology is key to understanding terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems at a time of unprecedented anthropogenic environmental change and offers substantial untapped potential to benefit humanity in a variety of ways, from improving agricultural practices to managing vector-borne diseases and inspiring technological advances. 2. We identified high priority challenges for entomology using an inclusive, open, and democratic four-stage prioritisation approach, conducted among the membership and affiliates (hereafter `members') of the UK-based Royal Entomological Society (RES). 3. A list of 710 challenges was gathered from 189 RES members. Thematic analysis was used to group suggestions, followed by an online vote to determine initial priorities, which were subsequently ranked during an online workshop involving 37 participants. 4. The outcome was a set of 61 priority challenges within four groupings of related themes: (i) `Fundamental Research' (themes: Taxonomy, `Blue Skies' [defined as research ideas without immediate practical application], Methods and Techniques); (ii) `Anthropogenic Impacts and Conservation' (themes: Anthropogenic Impacts, Conservation Options); (iii) `Uses, Ecosystem Services and Disservices' (themes: Ecosystem Benefits, Technology and Resources [use of insects as a resource, or as inspiration], Pests); (iv) `Collaboration, Engagement and Training' (themes: Knowledge Access, Training and Collaboration, Societal Engagement). 5. Priority challenges encompass research questions, funding objectives, new technologies, and priorities for outreach and engagement. Examples include training taxonomists, establishing a global network of insect monitoring sites, understanding the extent of insect declines, exploring roles of cultivated insects in food supply chains, and connecting professional with amateur entomologists. Responses to different challenges could be led by amateur and professional entomologists, at all career stages. 6. Overall, the challenges provide a diverse array of options to inspire and initiate entomological activities and reveal the potential of entomology to contribute to addressing global challenges related to human health and well-being, and environmental change.},

	abstract = {Tropical forest fragmentation is expected to result in the loss of forest-dependent species ('losers') and proliferation of disturbance-tolerant species ('winners'). Here, we use multi-species occupancy modelling to quantify the effects of fragmentation on Amazonian dung beetles at the species and community level. We investigate the relationship between species' habitat preferences and fragmentation responses to understand how interspecific variation in fragmentation responses translates into patterns of alpha and beta diversity. We sampled dung beetles within 21 forest patches and 2 continuous forests. For each site, we quantified three fragmentation metrics (area, shape, and surrounding forest amount) and modelled their effects on species occurrence and community properties. Most species were most likely to occur within large forest patches, while surrounding forest amount had a positive impact on all species. Over 80 \% of species were forest specialists and species' area responses were positively correlated with their level of forest specialization. Observed species-level responses were reflected at the community level, with greater representation of forest specialists in larger forest patches up to an 88-ha threshold, stabilizing thereafter; this threshold was met by only 1 \% of patches in the landscape. Species richness also increased with patch area, although surrounding forest amount had a greater positive impact. Communities were structured by a gradient of species turnover from small to large patches, and among more isolated patches. Our findings show that most Amazonian dung beetle species become `losers' within fragmented landscapes, particularly forest specialists. We recommend landscape-scale planning to retain forest connectivity including large forest remnants.},

	abstract = {1. The conversion of forests into open areas has large effects on the diversity and structure of native communities. The intensity of these effects may vary between regions, depending on the existence of native species adapted to open habitats in the regional pool or the time since habitat change. 2. We assess the differences in species richness and functional diversity of dung beetle communities (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) between native forests and novel pasturelands of the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado, two biomes with contrasting histories of human occupation in Brazil. We conducted standardized surveys in seven forest fragments and adjacent pastures in each region and measured 14 traits in individuals collected in each type of habitat at each particular site. We calculated functional richness, functional evenness, functional divergence, and community-weighted mean of traits for each area, and analyzed individual variation through nested variance decomposition and Trait Statistics. 3. Communities were richer and more numerous at the Cerrado. We did not find any consistent relationship between functional diversity and forest conversion beyond the changes in species diversity. Although landscape changes were more recent at the Cerrado, the colonization of the new habitat by native species already adapted to open habitats lessens the functional loss in this biome. This indicates that habitat change's effects on trait diversity depend on the regional species pool rather than on time since land conversion. 4. Forest conversion effects were primarily due to internal filtering. The effects of external filtering only appear at the intraspecific variance level, with contrasting differences between the Cerrado, where traits related to relocation behavior and size are selected, and the Atlantic Forest, where selection operates for traits related to relocation behavior and flight. These results evidence the importance of considering individual variance to address the responses of dung beetle communities to forest conversion.},

Habitat type affected the taxonomic dissimilarity and the richness difference component, with average values being respectively 1.42 and 1.56 times higher in pastures than in forest fragments. Only habitat type was important for functional richness, being 1.93 and 1.69 higher in forest fragments than pastures in 1999-2000 and 2016-2017, respectively. Pastures were taxonomically and functionally poorer but were also more temporally dynamic than forest fragments both within-year and between-years. Habitat type is a determining factor for temporal dynamics, with forest fragments presenting more stable dung beetle assemblages than cattle pastures.},

	abstract = {1. The replacement of natural systems with agricultural lands is the main factor resulting in land use change in tropical regions. Tropical savannas cover more than 20\% of the global land surface, and one-fifth of the world's population depends directly on these systems.2. Here, we aim to understand how the conversion of tropical savanna into exotic pastures affects the taxonomic and functional metrics of communities and dung removal, using dung beetles as a focal group in a biodiversity hotspot-the Brazilian Cerrado biome. We used species richness, abundance, total biomass, and species composition as assemblage metrics, and functional richness, equitability and dispersion indices, and functional composition as functional diversity metrics.3. The replacement of native savanna with exotic pastures negatively affected taxonomic and functional metrics, suggesting a simplified system where some disturbance-tolerant species become dominant. However, the relationship between dung removal and functional richness was higher in pastures compared to savanna.4. Our results demonstrated that responses of dung beetle assemblages and dung removal to land use changes are decoupled, idiosyncratic and context-dependent, presenting challenges for making predictions and generalisations about the effects of land use change on ecological processes mediated by animals.},

	abstract = {Background: Efforts to alleviate the negative effects of oil spills in the Ecuadorian Amazon include remediation activities such as cleaning, reshaping, and revegetation of polluted areas. However, studies of the diversity of biological communities in these hydrocarbon-degraded ecosystems have never been carried out. Here, we evaluated the diversity of dung beetles on remediated soil ecosystems (Agricultural Soils and Sensitive Ecosystems) and on non-contaminated soils (Natural Forests and Palm Plantations).Methodology: The study was conducted in Sucumbios and Orellana provinces, in the Ecuadorian Amazon at four sampling sites per ecosystem type (a total of 16 sites). At each sampling site, six pitfall traps remained active for 120 consecutive h per month for 1 year.Results: We collected 37 species and 7,506 individuals of dung beetles. We observed significant differences in mean species abundance, richness, and diversity between non-contaminated soil ecosystems and remediated soil ecosystems, with Natural Forests presenting the highest values, and Agricultural Soils the lowest values. Regarding sampling month, we also found significant differences among ecosystems, which were also higher in Natural Forests.Discussion: The results suggest that hydrocarbon-degraded ecosystems tend to conserve lower beetle diversity one year after remediation highlighting the importance of Natural Forests for the conservation of tropical biodiversity. Therefore, dung beetle diversity could be used for future landscape management of these hydrocarbon-degraded ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Dung beetles provide essential ecosystem services and serve as biodiversity indicators. Despite their importance, no studies have assessed their role in Pinus palustris (Longleaf Pine) forests. We assessed dung beetle diversity and abundance in a pristine Longleaf Pine forest in southwest Georgia, USA, by collecting beetles with pitfall traps in sites that excluded mammalian mesopredators as well as unfenced control sites. We collected 22 dung beetle taxa in total over a 24-month period and found higher beetle abundance and species richness in exclosure sites, though they showed no preference for dung source (i. e., Odocoileus virginianus [White- tailed Deer], Lynx rufus [Bobcat], Canis latrans [Coyote]). Melanocanthon bispinatus was the most abundant species (49.6\% of total beetles). Results provide insight into the interactions of dung beetles and predators in Longleaf Pine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Until now, little is known about the population structure and mobility of temperate dung beetles including the rainbow scarab, Phanaeus vindex (MacLeay 1819), although this knowledge is essential for their conservation as pastures become increasingly rare and the landscape fragmented by monocultures and urbanization. Here, we estimated population size, longevity, and dispersal within and between pastures. For 3 yr, we life-trapped beetles every week on 2 adjacent farms in SE Michigan, determined their sex, male morph, and size, and marked their elytra with individual tattoo patterns before releasing them. We marked a total of 470 rainbow scarabs of which 14 were recaptured once and 2 were recaptured twice. The sex ratio was not significantly sex-biased but fluctuated between months with no apparent uniformity between years. While the minor to major male ratios were unbiased in 2019 and 2020, they were marginally minor-biased in 2021. The gross population estimates for the 2 farms were 458-491 and 217 rainbow scarabs, respectively. Beetles traveled distances of up to 178 m within farms. No beetles dispersed between farms. One large female was recaptured after 338 days documenting the first cold hardiness and long lifespan of a cold-temperate dung beetle species in the wild. The low population estimates on both farms indicate 2 vulnerable populations with no or extremely limited connectivity. Supplementary funding for the land stewardship of small-scale cattle farmers could stabilize populations of native dung beetles and maintain their ecosystem services.},

A novel and striking case of interaction between a dung beetle (Thorectes lusitanicus) and two Quercus species (Q. suber and Q. canariensis) in forests of southern Spain is presented here. 2. During the autumn, T. lusitanicus beetles (endemic to the southern Iberian Peninsula) bury and feed on single-seeded fruits (acorns) of Quercus, with important ecological implications. 3. Field experiments found differences in the removal rate of acorns by T. lusitanicus, depending on the type of microsite within the forest, the species of oak, the exclosure of large herbivores, and the forest site. 4. Acorn consumption by T. lusitanicus was studied under laboratory conditions, confirming for the first time that this dung beetle is a legitimate seed predator. 5. In addition, some buried acorns can be abandoned partially predated or even intact, and emerge as seedlings; thus, T. lusitanicus also has a potential role as secondary seed disperser.},

The present study provides a standardized comparison between unbaited flight intercept traps (FIT) and baited pitfall traps (BPT) for sampling dung beetles. We examine the effectiveness of the two to assess fire disturbance effects and how trap performance is affected by seasonality. The study was carried out in a transitional forest between Cerrado (Brazilian Savanna) and Amazon Forest. Dung beetles were collected during one wet and one dry sampling season. The two methods sampled different portions of the local beetle assemblage. Both FIT and BPT were sensitive to fire disturbance during the wet season, but only BPT detected community differences during the dry season. Both traps showed similar correlation with environmental factors. Our results indicate that seasonality had a stronger effect than trap type, with BPT more effective and robust under low population numbers, and FIT more sensitive to fine scale heterogeneity patterns. This study shows the strengths and weaknesses of two commonly used methodologies for sampling dung beetles in tropical forests, as well as highlighting the importance of seasonality in shaping the results obtained by both sampling strategies.},

	abstract = {IntroductionThe standardization of sampling protocols is imperative for robustly studying any taxonomic group. Replicable methods allow the comparison of data between different spatial and temporal studies. In the case of dung beetles, one of the best-studied indicator groups in analyses of environmental disturbance, a wide range of collection methodologies are used, from basic pitfall traps to more complex or complementary methods such as mini-Winkler extractor. Also, different types of attractive baits, sampling effort, durations, and designs are used in dung beetle studies. Variations in methodological approaches are particularly noted in the Neotropics, which may be related to the vast number of biological strategies and behavior of dung beetles that inhabit this region. A lack of methodological unification for the Neotropical region makes a cross-sectional analysis of the information impossible.MethodsWe performed a compilation and analytical review of the existing literature for dung beetle sampling in the Neotropics, discussing the most used methodologies, their advantages and disadvantages, and specific cases in which particular models are more efficient.ResultsPitfall traps baited with human excrement are the most common sampling method, but there is a wide range of models and variations in the structure of this trap. The complementary effect generated by flight interception traps, light traps, and direct collections, particularly within microhabitats, is exciting for the potential of finding new species. Some methodologies, such as mini-Winkler extractor, fogging, or very specific baits, are infrequently used.DiscussionThere was a lack of inclusion of spatial and temporal variation among studies. Therefore, it is necessary to consider broader sampling windows, which include different spatial scales, seasons, and years. Finally, we propose a standard protocol for sampling dung beetles in the Neotropics, depending on each objective, and including a basic methodology for obtaining complete local inventories.},

	abstract = {Surveying terrestrial invertebrates often requires lethal techniques that can also kill non-target vertebrates. Removing the desirable components of biodiversity is at odds with the philosophy of ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation more generally. Moreover, commonly used metrics generated by such survey approaches (e.g. abundance and species richness) are only indirectly related to the ecosystem services (e.g. pollination) that are often of primary interest. We examined the relationship between rates of dung removal (a direct measure of an ecosystem service) and dung beetle abundance and species richness in a temperate region of New South Wales, Australia, and examined if dung removal in revegetated riparian areas of different ages were trending monotonically toward rates in areas with mature native vegetation. Pellets of pig manure and conventional traps were left at study sites for 48h to examine the relationships between rates of dung removal and dung beetle abundance and richness. Regressions of abundance and richness with average percent dung removal were positive and significant, demonstrating the potential of the method as a non-lethal proxy. While the dung removal method cannot determine the species responsible, percentage dung removal was more time-efficient, costing 4min per sample, while abundance and richness cost 13 and 17min, respectively. Despite variability among replicates of the same habitat type, the trajectory across the restoration gradient showed an increase from sites recently revegetated toward those with mature woody vegetation. We interpreted these results as a positive response of dung beetle activity and an indication of recovery of this ecosystem service. We argue that responses that can be collected efficiently such as dung removal should be used if restorationists have limited resources for data collection and analysis; non-specialists are involved; knowledge of ecosystem function is required, and animal ethics constrain options.},

For dung beetles, the most popular collection methodology is baited traps, followed by light traps and unbaited flight-intercept traps during diversity surveys. A less common collection method, flotation, is assumed to be laborious and messy, and so only a handful of papers exist on its refinement and strengths. Our purpose was threefold: First, we tested the recovery and survival rates of Labarrus (=Aphodius) pseudolividus (Balthasar) and Onthophagus taurus (Schreber) when floating beetle-seeded dung pats to determine potential collection and safety issues. We collected 72.4 and 78\% of the seeded L. pseudolividus and O. taurus, respectively, with \&gt;95\% survival rating. Second, we developed a flotation-sieving technique that enables users to rapidly collect and passively sort dung beetles with less time and effort. Specifically, we often collected 50–100 g of wild dung beetles within a couple of hours of gathering dung and sorted them in a couple more by allowing dung beetles to sort themselves by size within a series of sieves; Third, we reviewed flotation-based advantages and disadvantages in comparison to other methodologies.},

	abstract = {Ecological studies with Scarabaeinae dung beetles have increased exponentially over the past 30 years, using lethal pitfall traps baited with mammal feces or carrion as the preferred sampling method. Different studies have determined the distance between pitfall traps for effective sampling, but the number of traps is often subjective, leading to excessive or poor sampling. This study provides quantitative guidelines for establishing the sample size for optimal completeness of dung beetle diversity by systematically reviewing the relationship between sampling intensity and sampling coverage, habitat type, and the journal impact factor in peer-reviewed research. We gathered 94 studies covering a range from México to Argentina. Sampling was conducted mainly in forested habitats, followed by treeless agriculture and agroforestry systems, with a median value of 50 pitfall traps per sampled habitat. Sampling completeness was above 0.9 in 95\% of the studies. Oversampling ranged from 1 to more than 96,000 individuals, and sampling deficit varied between 2 and 3,300 specimens. Sampling intensity and the journal impact factor were significantly and positively correlated with oversampling, but these variables did not explain the sampling deficit. The positive correlation between journal impact factor and oversampling may reflect a publication bias where high-impact journals and researchers seek more generalizable information obtained with a higher sampling intensity. Dung beetle oversampling was not homogeneous between habitats, being highest in old-growth forests and lowest in disturbed habitats such as pastures and forest edges. Our results show that the collection intensity used in dung beetle studies should be reconsidered carefully. By incorporating ethical principles used in animal science, we suggest sampling guidelines for a robust sampling scheme of dung beetle diversity, which would also prevent oversampling. Consciously reducing sampling intensity will make resource use more cost-effective. We suggest increasing the number of independent sampling units rather than intensifying subsampling, thereby increasing the predictive power of statistical models to obtain more robust evidence of the phenomena under study.},

Here we investigate how the choice of baits (human feces, cattle dung, carrion or a combination of all three) and sampling season influence the taxonomic and functional diversity of insects captured in traps in Brazilian pastures. We sampled dung beetles in July 2011 (dry season) and January 2012 (rainy season) in eight areas: four pastures with native grasses (e.g., Andropogon spp. and Axonopus spp.) and four pastures with introduced grasses (Urochloa spp.) in Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. To collect the insects, we used pitfall traps baited with carrion, cattle dung and human feces. A total of 7,086 dung beetles of 32 species were captured. In both pasture types, only traps baited with human feces captured similar abundance, species richness, and functional diversity compared with the sum total of beetles captured by the three bait types. The species richness and functional diversity were higher in the rainy season in both pasture types. Our results demonstrate that using human feces alone as bait and sampling dung beetles in the rainy season are potentially sufficient to ensure the greatest number of functional traits, species, and individuals in both pasture types. Thus, the best sampling method observed in this study may be useful for studies focused on dung beetle fauna survey and rigorous comparison among studies on these insects in Brazilian pastures.},

	abstract = {The accurate sampling of communities is vital to any investigation of ecological processes and biodiversity. Dung beetles have emerged as a widely used focal taxon in environmental studies and can be sampled quickly and inexpensively using baited pitfalls. Although there is now a wealth of available data on dung beetle communities from around the world, there is a lack of standardisation between sampling protocols for accurately sampling dung beetle communities. In particular, bait choice is often led by the idiosyncrasies of the researcher, logistic problems and the dung sources available, which leads to difficulties for inter-study comparisons. In general, human dung is the preferred choice, however, it is often in short supply, which can severely limit sampling effort. By contrast, pigs may produce up to 20 times the volume. We tested the ability of human and pig dung to attract a primary forest dung beetle assemblage, as well as three mixes of the two baits in different proportions. Analyses focussed on the comparability of sampling with pig or human-pig dung mixes with studies that have sampled using human dung. There were no significant differences between richness and abundance sampled by each bait. The assemblages sampled were remarkably consistent across baits, and ordination analyses showed that the assemblages sampled by mixed dung baits were not significantly different from that captured by pure human dung, with the assemblages sampled by 10\% and 90\% pig mixes structurally most similar to assemblages sampled by human dung. We suggest that a 10:90 human:pig ratio, or similar, is an ideal compromise between sampling efficiency, inter-study comparability and the availability of large quantities of bait for sampling Amazonian dung beetles. Assessing the comparability of assemblage samples collected using different baits represents an important step to facilitating large-scale meta-analyses of dung beetle assemblages collected using non-standard methodology.},

	abstract = {The seasonal occurrence of species and timing of key events in their life (phenology) affects the ecology and evolution of every species, population, and species community (SC) on Earth. Shifting phenologies and mismatches between species may affect range limits and lead to extinctions and biodiversity loss, which are especially concerning in ecologically and economically important SCs like coprophilous beetles. This study provides phenological data for many species of coprophilous beetles from the Midwestern region of the United States, includes the often-missing winter months, and compares the seasonal and successional differences between the “relocator” and “dweller” guilds. Beetles were sampled biweekly throughout the year from a 3.8 ha Farm in Adrian, SE-Michigan using 15 pitfall traps baited with cow manure. Samples were collected after 48 h and again after 72 h exposure time. Over the entire year, I caught 6,069 specimens from 24 species of Scarabaeoidea and 13 species of Hydrophilidae. The ROSARIO null model for continuous temporal data suggested a significant seasonal overlap of the SC (p {\textless} 0.0001) and a cluster analysis based on Pianka’s niche overlap index identified five clusters at a minimum overlap of 55\% falling into three major phenological guilds. “Relocators” (6 Scarabaeinae, 2 Aphodiinae species) overlapped on average by 48.4\%, whereas “dwellers” (9 Aphodiinae, 10 Hydrophilidae species) overlapped by 36.0\% (Mann–Whitney test, p = 0.055). Small Hydrophilidae dwellers overlapped by 30.9\% whereas large hydrophilid dwellers overlapped by 96.9\%. Individual phenological patterns were compared to other sites in North America and Europe and predictions about geographical and phenological changes due to the man-made climate crisis and habitat loss and fragmentation are discussed. Differences between the seasonal overlaps of “relocators” and “dwellers” as well as small and large Onthophagus relocators and Hydrophilidae dwellers are suggesting profound ecological differences between the guilds and sub-guilds.},

	abstract = {The diel activity of dung beetles is poorly understood in Australia. Understanding diel activity is fundamental to understanding the ecology and management of these insects. The diel activity is typically measured using ground-based pitfall traps, which require manual changing. Here we showcase a time sorting pitfall trap (TSPT) that allows for automated time sorted sampling of dung beetle communities to help investigate diel activity and determine abiotic triggers of diel activity. Testing was undertaken to determine the following: 1) Can the TSPT capture dung beetles at eight (3-hr interval) time points throughout a 24-hr period? 2) How efficiently can the TSPT capture dung beetles compared to a ground-based pan trap? 3) How does the height of the TSPT (standing vs. buried) affect the species diversity and abundance? We found that the TSPT successfully captured dung beetles at different time intervals, providing an assessment of beetle activity. We provide examples from two locally abundant dung beetles species, Labarrus lividus (Olivier, 1789) (Aphodiinae) and Onthophagus binodis (Thunberg, 1818) (Scarabaeinae). The height of the TSPT negatively influenced species diversity and abundance compared to ground-based pan traps. When we compared the results of pan traps and the equivalent of a buried TSPT (TSPT lid with pan trap underneath set at ground height), no difference was detected in overall species diversity, yet abundance was still reduced. When the height of the TSPT was reduced, only 20\% of the abundance was captured compared to the ground pan trap. Overall, the TSPT worked for the intended purpose of measuring diel activity though it should be buried or have its height reduced to improve capture rate.},

In North Florida, there is a high diversity of dung beetles due to the intentional and accidental introduction of non-native species. Understanding patterns and processes on local scales is important for conservational planning. The aim of this study was to evaluate how dung beetle communities respond to different dung sources, forage composition, and habitat types. We surveyed for the presence and distribution of dung beetles in an open field and forest as well as in three types of pasture forage designs. In the first experiment, four transects with pitfall traps from forest to open field were established with either horse, pig, or cow feces bait. In the second experiment, three cattle grazing systems with different forage species were tested with only cow feces. In the first experiment, 16 species were identified between the field and forest sites including native and exotic species. Although the dung type had little effect on beetle distribution, a significantly different distribution of dung beetles between the field and forest was observed. Only one species, Onthophagus hecate Panzer (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) showed no preference between open field and forest habitat. During this second experiment, no difference in dung beetle distribution was found between the three types of pasture assemblages. This study supports habitat type as a driver of interspecies distribution and diversity of dung beetles in North Florida.},

S. invicta caused 94.3 and 62.9\% mortality of horn flies for 1992 and 1993, respectively. It also reduced the populations of staphylinid, hydrophilid, and carabid beetles that are predators of horn flies.

The fauna was studied at eleven sites and 45 species were recorded. Three geographical species groups (1, 2, 3) were defined for 38 of the species using multivariate techniques. The other seven species have dissimilar widespread distributions and are treated as a fourth group (4). Two groups (1, 3) comprising 31 and three species, respectively, are either endemic or largely restricted to the winter and bimodal rainfall regions of southern Africa. They show extreme numerical dominance in indigenous shrubland but are also well-represented in pasture. Groups 1 and 3 comprise primarily day-flying taxa with an overall peak in abundance during the moist spring. These endemic groups are probably associated with the inception of winter rainfall climate during the Pliocene rt 3 million years before present. The other two groups (2, 4) have a distribution extending into the adjacent summer rainfall region. In the southwestern Cape, they are found predominantly in recently-created pastures. They include equal numbers of day and dusk/night-flying species with peaks in abundance mainly during the dry summer. Most species of these two groups are taxonomically distant from endemic taxa. Frequency of Group 2 relative to climate was greatest in the westerly summer rainfall region one whereas that of Group 4 was greatest in the south-easterly bimodal rainfall region. As most members of Groups 2 and 4 show limited penetration into indigenous shrubland, the findings suggest that these summer-active groups dispersed from the summer rainfall into the winter rainfall region via western and eastern coastal corridors in response to the thinning or clearance of the formerly ubiquitous native shrubs.},

A total of 14,269 beetles representing 36 species were captured. Onthophagus batesi, Canthon femoralis, Canthidium centrale, Copris laeviceps, O. rhinolophus and Deltochilium pseudoparile accounted for 75\% of the captures in the overall sample from 79 sites. Across forest fragments capture rates of species and individuals were associated positively to area and negatively to isolating distance. Rarefaction analysis showed that forest fragments were the most species-rich habitats followed by the mixed and cacao plantations, the forest edge, live fences and coffee, citrus and allspice plantations. Pastures were the least species-rich habitat. Horizontal and vertical diversity of the vegetation at the habitats studied influenced the species richness of dung and carrion beetles and the number of species in common between forest fragments and human-made habitats. A significant relationship existed between the number of non-flying mammals recorded at the study sites and the richness of species and individuals of dung beetles at the habitats investigated. The relevance of this information is discussed in the light of the ecological flexibility of dung and carrion beetle species and of possible conservation scenarios involving landscapes in which isolation of forest fragments is reduced by the presence in open areas of human-made vegetation such as plantations of cacao, coffee, cacao and coffee and live fences.},

	abstract = {Aim (1) To review briefly global biogeographical patterns in dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae), a group whose evolutionary history has been dominated by ecological specialization to vertebrate dung in warmer climates. (2) To develop hypotheses accounting for the evolution of these patterns. Location Six principal biogeographical regions: Palaearctic, Oriental, Afrotropical, Australasia, Neotropical, Nearctic and five outlying islands or island groups harbouring endemic genera: Caribbean, Madagascar, Mauritius, New Caledonia, New Zealand. Methods Major patterns of tribal, generic and species distribution are investigated using cluster analysis, ordination, parsimony analysis of endemism and track analysis. Attempts are made to resolve biogeographical patterns with findings in the fields of plate tectonics, fossil and evolutionary history, plus phylogeny of both mammals and dung beetles. Results Because of conflict between published findings, it is uncertain at what point in time density of dinosaur dung, mammal dung or both became sufficiently great to select for specialized habits in dung beetles. However, biogeographical evidence would suggest a Mesozoic origin followed by further taxonomic radiation during the Cenozoic, possibly in response to the increasing size and diversity of mammalian dung types in South America and Afro-Eurasia. Proportional generic distribution in fourteen tribes and subtribes showed four principal biogeographical patterns: (1) southerly biased Gondwanaland distribution, (2) Americas or (3) Madagascar endemism, and (4) northerly biased, Afro-Eurasian-centred distribution with limited numbers of genera also widespread in other regions. Proportional composition of faunas in eleven geographical regions indicated three principal distributional centres, East Gondwanaland fragments, Afro-Eurasia and the Americas. These patterns probably result from three principal long-term range expansion and vicariance events (Mesozoic: Gondwanaland interchange and fragmentation, Cenozoic: Afro-Eurasian/Nearctic interchange and the Great American interchange). It is suggested that old vicariance caused by the Mesozoic fragmentation of Gondwanaland leads to a high degree of regional endemism at generic or tribal level across one or more Gondwanaland tracks. In contrast, it is suggested that the more recent Cenozoic range expansions occurred primarily towards northern regions leading to endemism primarily at species level. These Cenozoic radiations were facilitated by the re-linking of continents, either because of tectonic plate movements (Africa to Eurasia in Miocene), climatically induced sea-level change (Afro-Eurasia to Nearctic in Miocene and Pleistocene), or similar coupled with orogenics (Nearctic to Neotropical in Pliocene). Speciation has followed vicariance either because of climatic change or physical barrier development. These recent range expansions probably occurred principally along an Afro-Eurasian land track to the Nearctic and Neotropical and an Americas land track northwards from the Neotropics to the Nearctic, with limited dispersal from Eurasia to Australia, probably across a sea barrier. This accounts for the overall, spatially constrained, biogeographical pattern comprising large numbers of species-poor genera endemic to a single biogeographical region and fewer more species-rich genera, many of which show wider biogeographical distributions. In most southerly regions (Australasia, Madagascar, Neotropical), faunal composition and generic endemism is primarily dominated by elements with Gondwanaland ancestry, which is consistent with the Gondwanaland origin claimed for Scarabaeinae. In Afro-Eurasia (Palaearctic, Oriental, Afrotropical), generic endemism of monophyletically derived Afro-Eurasian and widespread lineages is centred in the Afrotropical region and faunal composition is numerically dominated by Afro-Eurasian and widespread elements. In the Nearctic region, the fauna is jointly dominated by widespread elements, derived from Afro-Eurasia, and Gondwanaland and Americas elements derived from the Neotropical region. Main conclusions Global biogeographical patterns in scarabaeine dung beetles primarily result from Mesozoic and Cenozoic range expansion events followed by vicariance, although recent dispersal to Australia may have occurred across sea barriers. Detailed phylogenetics research is required to provide data to support dispersal/vicariance hypotheses.},

Respiration rate also increased (P ¡ 0.001) and specific respiration (q) was higher (P ¡ 0.05) in soil treated with beef cattle dung than in that treated with dairy cow dung.

	abstract = {In Neotropical rain forests, fresh mammal dung, especially that of howler monkeys, constitutes an important resource used by dung beetles as food and for oviposition and further feeding by their larvae. Tropical rain forest destruction, fragmentation, and subsequent isolation causing reductions in numbers of and the disappearance of howler moneys may result in decreasing numbers of dung beetles, but this has not been documented. In this study, we present information on the presence of howlers and dung beetles in 38 isolated forest fragments and 15 agricultural habitats. Howler monkeys were censused by visual means, while dung beetles were sampled with traps baited with a mixture of howler, cow, horse, and dog dung. Results indicated that loss of area and isolation of forest fragments result in significant decrements in howlers and dung beetles. However, dung beetle abundance was found to be closely related to the presence of howler monkeys at the sites and habitats investigated. Scenarios of land management designed to reduce isolation among forest fragments may help sustain populations of howler monkeys and dung beetles, which may have positive consequences for rain forest regeneration.

	abstract = {Aim: To identify biogeographical boundaries which are obscured by faunal overlap and habitat modification. Location: KwaZulu-Natal in south-east, South Africa beyond the southern tip of the Mocambique Coastal Plain. Methods: Species abundance data for dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabacinae) were collected at six levels from the coastal escarpment (30 degrees 16'S - 500 m) to the top of the nearby Drakensberg (29 degrees 35'S - 2850 m). Cross-altitudinal boundaries were identified using clustering techniques, beta-diversity indices, and range edge analysis. Biogeographical data for the species were drawn from an extensive reference collection and used to classify the biogeographical affinities of the assemblages. Results: Three discrete communities are defined (¡10\% similarity) from species abundance distributions. These communities occur in coastal forest (500 m), coastal to highveld grassland (500-1500 m), and montane grassland (1900-2850 m). Two of these communities are biogeographically homogeneous comprising ¿89\% east coast endemics (coastal forest) or ¿84\% South African montane endemics (montane grassland) in terms of abundance. The third community in coastal to highveld grassland is biogeographically more heterogeneous. Predominant biota of this community comprise both South African highveld endemics and elements with distributions extending into the tropics. At highveld levels (1500 m), there are proportionately more highveld endemics whereas at lowland levels (500 m), there are proportionately more tropical elements. At 1000 m, there was a change in the balance between these two groups across an anthropogenic gradient due to a decline in the proportion of endemics in favour of temperate/tropical generalists. This gradient from a natural grassland fragment to improved pastures of Kikuyu grass also parallels a decline in species richness and abundance. Species turnover analyses showed three different cross-altitudinal patterns. Range-edge analysis showed a trimodal pattern of species turnover (peaks in forest and the Drakensberg foothills as in the community analysis but also at (1000 m). Five beta-diversity indices showed either a bimodal pattern of turnover (forest/grassland and foothills/middle Drakensberg slopes) or a trimodal turnover pattern (forest/grassland, highveld Drakensberg foothills, Drakensberg peaks). Main conclusions: Clear altitudinal zonation is revealed by community and biogeographical analysis but one natural biogeographical boundary may be obscured by the process of habitat modification. This boundary at 1000 m is revealed by range-edge analysis and is supported by findings for plant communities. Beta-diversity, species turnover patterns diverged slightly from those suggested by the community and range-edge analyses.},

	abstract = {The possible stratification of charcoal particles buried in well-drained soil in the subalpine and alpine belts in an inner valley of the northwestern Alps (Savoy, France) is examined. Radiocarbon dating and quantification of charcoal fragments more than 400 mum in diameter were used to analyse the soil-depth distribution of charred wood particles between 1700 and 2600 m a.s.l. in two study areas 10 km apart in the same valley. Above 2100 m a.s.l. in both study areas, charcoal concentrations are low and mainly contained in the upper horizons, and all dated charcoal fragments are older than 2300 cal. yr BP. Below 2100 m, the greatest charcoal concentration is located in the topmost 30 cm of the soil profiles, and the C-14 dates yield late-Holocene ages (1600 to 75 cal. yr BP). When profiles have an elevated charcoal concentration in deeper horizons the charcoal dates are mid-Holocene (6360-2770 cal. yr BP). Radiocarbon dates of charcoal fragments do not reveal an age/depth relationship, although charcoal mass concentrations suggest a coarse stratification of charcoal particles in the soils below 2100 m at forested sires. This difference may be due to the charcoal dating on a single fragment which is not representative of the charcoal assemblage containing a few tens to thousands of fragments. The lack of stratification probably results from soil bioturbation by soil fauna, soil reworking by uprooted trees, and freeze-thaw processes. At higher elevation in the alpine belt, charcoal is concentrated in the topmost soil due to a low bioturbation rate. From a pedological point of view, the C-14 dating and the quantification of charcoal concentration per soil level provides a time range estimate for soil-particle reworking by anecic earthworms, dung beetles and other biota. This has application in pedogenesis studies to estimate the rapidity of processes of soils dynamics. These data suggest that soils in the Alps have limited potential for palaeoecological studies based on a stratigraphic assumption but have more applications in precise spatial studies.},

	abstract = {1. We reviewed the use of dung beetles as indicators of environmental change, highlighting the influence of natural forest dynamics on species distributions in primary forest and suggesting new ways in which this can be used to understand and interpret the effects of disturbance such as logging. These ideas were applied to rainforest dung beetle communities in Sabah, Malaysia. 2. Dung beetle samples, using baited pitfall and flight intercept traps, were examined from primary, logged and plantation forests. Cluster analysis on dung beetle assemblages from primary forest samples showed clear species associations that had a high degree of fidelity to a particular biotope or vegetation type. Beetles were grouped into riverine-edge, riverine, interior-primary and `even' (equitable distribution between biotopes) associations. Although biotope-specific associations were spatially separate in primary forest, these associations overlapped at forest margins (riverine forest) and in logged forest (to form `composite assemblages'). 3. Species associations showed different responses to disturbance: the riverine association included many species that showed a positive response to at least some types of disturbance, whereas others were neutral or negative in response; the even association species were mostly neutral; the primary forest associations were almost entirely negative in response. 4. The greatest faunal similarities were found between logged forest and riverine assemblages. Diversity was lower in logged compared with primary forest, and the lowest species richness and diversity were recorded in plantation forest. Small-scale species richness in logged forest was generally higher than in individual transects from primary forest due to the presence of overlapping species ranges (composite assemblages) that were usually spatially separate in primary forest. Data suggested that increased species richness at a fine scale does not necessarily mean that species richness is greater at a larger scale, and that species mixing in derived ecosystems is dependent on the type of disturbance. Forest management should aim to minimize the mixing of the components of different biotopes, by implementing low impact (i.e. reduced-impact logging) harvesting techniques.},

	abstract = {This paper examines dung beetle communities in remnant patches of tropical deciduous forest at Veracruz, Mexico, as a case study of the effects of tropical deforestation on biodiversity. The two study areas have a common biogeographic history and similar macroclimatic conditions and have been modified by human activities to different extents. The main difference between them is that cattle, which provide the dung beetle's food supply, are present in only one of the areas. Comparison of the dung beetle faunas sheds light on the relative importance of forest cover versus food supply as the principal factor determining the structure and diversity of the fauna. This comparison, which we broaden through an examination of data from other localities in central Veracruz, permits us to Speculate about what happens to biodiversity when a tropical deciduous forest undergoes modification of varying type and intensity. Where tree cover has been most modified, native forest species undergo local extinction and are replaced by open area species. On the whole, there has not been a net reduction in species richness (gamma diversity) in the fragmented landscape of central Veracruz, although local species richness (alpha diversity) has diminished.},

The four habitats had similar richness, species composition, and assemblage structure of dung and carrion beetles. Differences were found in abundance and biomass levels for the four dominant species in the landscape. Dung beetles were more abundant than carrion beetles, but the biomass was higher for the latter. Carrion beetles were seasonal, while dung beetles were clearly not. When forest fragments and shade coffee plantations were compared to other similar habitats in the region, the same general pattern was observed. However, forests with high disturbance and monospecific shade coffee plantations had lower species richness than forests with low and medium disturbance and polyspecific shade coffee plantations. Thus shade coffee plantations maintain connectivity between patches of cloud forest in a landscape that is strongly affected by human activities. Protecting landscape diversity appears to ensure high species richness.},

We sampled in three tropical montane cloud forest fragments and in three coffee plantations with traditional polyculture shade between 1998 and 2001. The three indicator groups responded differently to the transformation of tropical montane cloud forest into shaded coffee plantations. The species richness of frogs was one-fifth less in coffee plantations than in forest fragments, and only one-third of the frog species occurred in both forest fragments and coffee plantations. The number of beetle species and their abundance was significantly greater in coffee plantations than in the forest fragments, whereas species richness and species composition of bats were virtually the same in both habitats. The majority of the abundant species remained as such in both communities, but species that were less abundant were not scarce in both habitats. We attributed differences in the species assemblages to the differing degrees of penetrability of the borders of the two habitat types (especially for the coffee plantations) and to the differences in life-history traits among species. Shaded coffee plantations form a matrix that envelops the remaining fragments of cloud forest. Together they connect the forest fragments with the other habitats of the landscape and represent a highly functional resource for the preservation of biodiversity that serves as a complement to but not a substitute for cloud forest in this notably modified landscape.},

Study sites included a dairy located in the piedmont region (North Carolina Department of Agriculture Piedmont Research Station, Salisbury, NC) and a combined dairy/beef facility in the coastal plain (North Carolina Department of Agriculture Center for Environmental Farming Systems, Goldsboro, NC). Dung beetles were trapped in cattle pastures from March 2002 through September 2003 by using dung-baited pitfall traps. Trapping yielded 4,111 beetles representing 14 species from the piedmont dairy, including Aphodius prodromus Brahm, a new record for North Carolina. Totals of 57,026 beetles representing 28 species and 28,857 beetles representing 26 species were trapped from the dairy unit and beef unit in the coastal plain site, respectively. Onthophagus gazella (F.), a second new record for North Carolina, was collected from the coastal plain. Beetles common to all collection sites include Aphodius erraticus (L.), Aphodius fimetarius (L.), Aphodius granarius (L.), Aphodius pseudolividus Balthasar, Onthophagus tattrus Scbreber, Onthophagus hecate hecate Panzer, and Onthophagus pennsylvanicus Harold. The introduced beetle O. taurus dominated the dung beetle population, accounting for ¿ 50\% of the total beetles caught at either site. Beetle activity was greatest from March until November, with activity declining during the winter. Nine exotic species in the genera Onthophagus and Aphodius represented nearly 95\% of the beetles trapped.},

	abstract = {Fragmentation is the most common disturbance induced by humans in tropical forests. Some insect groups are particularly suitable for studying the effects of fragmentation on animal communities because they are taxonomically and ecologically homogenous. We investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on a dung beetle species community in the forest archipelago created in 1994-1995 by the dam of Petit Saut, French Guiana. We set and baited an equal number of pitfall traps for dung beetles on three mainland sites and seven island sites. The sites ranged from 1.1 to 38 ha. In 250 trap days, we captured 50 species in 19 genera. Diversity indices were high (2.18-4.06). The lowest diversity was on the small islands and one mainland site. Species richness and abundance were positively related to fragment area but not to distance from mainland or distance to the larger island. The islands had lower species richness and population than mainland forest, but rarefied species richness was relatively invariant across sites. There was a marked change in species composition with decreasing fragment that was not caused by the presence of a common fauna of disturbed area species on islands. Small islands differed from larger islands, which did not differ significantly from mainland sites. Partial correlation analyses suggested that species richness and abundance of dung beetle species were positively related to the number of species of nonflying mammals and the density index of howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus), two parameters positively related to fragment area.},

	abstract = {With the aim of determining what kind of landscape mosaics might sustain maximum diversity and minimum species loss, dung beetles were sampled with baited pitfall traps to compare species richness and species composition in a tract of continuous forest, forest fragments and a habitat island consisting of a mosaic of forest and arboreal crops in Los Tuxtlas, southern Mexico. We captured 7332 dung beetles representing 33 species. Similar numbers of species were captured in the three habitats. However, 56\% of individuals were captured in the continuous forest, 29\% in the mosaic habitat and 15\% in the forest fragments. Eight species (Canthon femoralis, Copris laeviceps, Canthidium centrale, Onthophagus batesi, Deltochilum pseudoparile, O. rhinolophus, Canthon viridis vazquezae and Dichotomius satanus) accounted for 90\% of the captures, but their relative dominance varied among habitats. A clear trend was evident in the number of dung beetles captured in the dung processing guilds (rollers / tunnelers) as well as in the diurnal and nocturnal guilds, with captures decreasing from the continuous forest to the mosaic habitat to the forest fragments. A similar trend was detected in detection rates for medium and small size dung producing mammals. Species richness of forest fragments and mosaic habitat did not differ from that found in the continuous forest, but these habitats differ significantly in species richness from isolated shaded and unshaded plantations, linear strips of vegetation, the forest-pasture edge and pastures according to rarefaction analysis. The co-occurrence of the continuous forest, the mosaic habitat and the cluster of forest fragments in close proximity seems to be preserving a diverse assemblage of dung beetle species in the local landscape.},

	abstract = {I compared dung beetle communities and assessed some of their functional effects (dung removal, seed burial, seedling establishment) in continuous forest with those in 1-ha and 10-ha forest fragments in Central Amazonia. I followed the fate of seeds until seedling establishment for three native tree species, using clean seeds and seeds surrounded by dung. The 1-ha fragments had half the number of dung beetle species captured in continuous forest and in 10-ha fragments. The continuous forest sites and the 1-ha fragments had similar number of individuals, but in the 10-ha fragments dung beetles were twice as abundant. Mean beetle size increased with increasing forest area. Dung removal and seed burial rates were higher in continuous forest than in forest fragments. Seed predation rates were higher in the forest fragments. In all sites, the proportion of seedlings established from seeds surrounded by dung vs clean seeds was the same, and it was the same in continuous forest vs fragments. When comparing seeds that remained on the forest floor with seeds buried by dung beetles, a higher percentage of seedlings established from the latter. Conservation programs that aim to maintain the regeneration ability of forest fragments must incorporate all the important components involved in seedling establishment; in Central Amazonia these include dung beetles as secondary dispersers. It is important that studies start measuring directly not only the first-order effects of forest fragmentation on species, but also the higher-order functional effects.},

	abstract = {Habitat fragmentation and the widespread creation of habitat edges have recently stimulated interest in assessing the effects of ecotones on biodiversity. Ecotones, natural or anthropogenic, can greatly affect faunal movement, population dynamics, species interactions, and community structure. Few data exist, however, on insect community response to forest-savanna ecotones, a natural analog to anthropogenically cleared areas adjacent to forest. In this study, the abundance, total biomass, average individual biomass, and distribution of scarabaeine dung beetles were examined at a sharp tropical evergreen forest-savanna ecotone in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. The abundance, total biomass, and average individual biomass of dung beetles varied significantly across the forest, edge, and savanna habitats. Species richness (S(obs)) also varied significantly across the three habitats, but statistical estimations of true species richness (S(est)) did not. Habitat specificity of the dung beetles in this study was extremely high. Of the 50 most common species collected during the study, only 2 species were collected in both the forest and savanna habitats, signaling nearly complete community turnover in just a few meters. Strong edge effects were evidenced by the decline in abundance, total biomass, and species richness at the forest-savanna boundary.},

	abstract = {Given current accelerated trends of tropical land conversion, forest fragments are being incorporated into many conservation programs. For investing in fragments to be a viable conservation strategy, forest fragments must maintain their ecological integrity over the long term. Based on fieldwork in 22 forest fragments in the crater lakes region of western Uganda and in the continuous forest of Kibale National Park, we examined (1) seed predation on experimentally dispersed seeds, (2) abundance and composition of the dung beetle community that may play a major role in removing seeds from sites of high seed predation, and (3) compared the fragments' seedling community composition to adult tree community composition and the seedling community in continuous forest. First, the rate of seed removal at experimental stations was lower in forest fragments (85\% remaining after 1 day) than at stations in the continuous forest (79\% remaining) and the probability of stations being discovered by seed predators was lower in fragments (23\%) than in the intact forest (41\%). Second, there was a 62 percent decline in fragment dung beetle abundance. The magnitude of this decline varied among dung beetle guilds that process dung and seeds in different fashions. The abundance of large rollers that move large seeds away from sites of defecation did not differ, but medium and smaller rollers and burying beetles that process small and medium-sized seeds were less common in the fragments than in the intact forest. Finally, we compared the seedling community composition relative to adult tree community composition by identifying all adult trees in each fragment and by sampling the composition of the seedling community. We found some evidence to suggest that there was movement of seeds among forest fragments by large-bodied dispersers, particularly chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and hornbills (Ceratogymna subcylindricus).},

The total number of species per habitat was similar (between 10 species in cropland and 13 in secondary forest). Inventory completeness was over 90\%, except for cropland where over 82\% of the true species richness was recorded. Greater numbers of species and individuals were found in primary forest than in secondary forest and pasture. Fifty-five percent of all individuals were captured in cropland where the number of species was similar to that recorded for secondary forest. Species turnover was highest between primary forest and cropland (of 18 species, 4 were present in both). Primary and secondary forest had the lowest turnover of species (of 14, 11 species present in both). Guild distribution depended on habitat type: in primary and secondary forest, the most common species were nocturnal tunnelers, while in pasture and cropland, there were more diurnal species of various habits. These results support the idea that regeneration areas and certain land use systems can mitigate the detrimental effects that clearing the original vegetation has on biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Variations in assemblage attributes across ecotones provides clear examples on how organisms perceive and respond to environmental changes, even at small scales. Dung beetles (Scarabaeidae) have been used as bioindicators of habitat quality due to their sensitivity to environmental changes. Dung beetles were sampled across a natural forest-cerrado ecotone in Brazil, and associated changes in assemblage structure were examined. Edge effects, here defined as consistent changes in assemblage parameters in relation to the distance to the forest-cerrado border, were also examined. Density of individuals and species were higher in the forest than in the cerrado, but overall richness was similar between habitats after controlling for sample sizes. Species composition differed greatly between habitats, and shared species were consistently more abundant in one or another habitat. Edge effects were not detected on richness nor species composition, and only weak effects were observed on abundance. It is concluded that the effect of the habitat (forest vs. cerrado) has a much stronger effect on the assemblage structure than the presence of the edge: dung beetles responded strongly to change in habitats, but weakly to the proximity of the edge between these habitats.},

	abstract = {Few studies have directly assessed how rapidly functionally important insect communities recover following rain forest loss and fragmentation. In 1986, B. Klein compared the dung and carrion beetle assemblages of clearcuts, fragmented, and non-fragmented forests in central Amazonia, reporting drastic short-term changes in community composition. Fifteen years later, we resampled the same sites using identical techniques and found that, with the regrowth of secondary vegetation between forest fragments, the initial differences had largely disappeared. As the secondary vegetation itself supports dung beetle assemblages similar to those of continuous forest, we conclude that, from the perspective of the dung beetles, the experimentally fragmented area had returned to a continuous state within approximately one decade. These results offer some good news for the conservation of tropical ecosystems, since they suggest that conditions favorable for functionally important arthropods may be quickly restored by secondary regrowth. They also suggest that the preservation of forest fragments and secondary vegetation may provide an important complement to the conservation of intact mature forest.},

	abstract = {Arthropod assemblages were examined in Lama forest reserve, a protected area situated in the Dahomey gap, southern Benin, composed of plantations, degraded forest and remnants of natural forest. The objectives were to compare assemblages in relation to forest type and use, to elucidate the value of forest plantations for biodiversity conservation and to identify indicator species for specific forest habitats. Arthropods were collected over an 11-month period, using standardized sets of traps (pitfall, emergence, Malaise and flight intercept traps). Nine different habitats were studied, including natural and degraded forest, forest plantations (Tectona grandis and Senna siamea) of different age, and isolated forest fragments. Our analysis focused on detritivorous and xylophagous arthropods but also included ground beetles and heteropterans, totalling 393 species. We found no differences in species richness among natural and degraded forest habitats in the centre of the reserve (Noyau central). Outside of the Noyau central, species richness was highest in old teak plantations and isolated forest fragments and lowest in young teak and fuelwood plantations. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) separated three main groups: (1) natural forest, (2) degraded forest and young plantations, and (3) old plantations and isolated forest fragments. Multiple regression of DCA scores of the first two axes on environmental variables identified one natural and three disturbance-related predictors of arthropod assemblages in Lama forest: soil type (texture), canopy height, naturalness (proportion of Guineo-Congolian plant species) and understorey vegetation cover. We identified 15 indicator species for six different forest habitats. The highest numbers were found in abandoned settlements and old teak plantations. beta-diversity was similar among the three DCA ordination groups (degraded forest excluded). Values for beta-diversity were relatively high, suggesting that all major forest habitats contribute significantly to regional species pools and should therefore be protected. To enhance arthropod diversity, we propose that management practices in Lama forest should aim to encourage the development of species-rich understorey vegetation of the Guineo-Congolian phytogeographical region.},

	abstract = {As tropical regions are converted to agriculture, conservation of biodiversity will depend not only on the maintenance of protected forest areas, but also on the scope for conservation within the agricultural matrix in which they are embedded. Tree cover typically retained in agricultural landscapes in the neotropics may provide resources and habitats for animals, but little is known about the extent to which it contributes to conservation of animal species. Here, we explore the animal diversity associated with different forms of tree cover for birds, bats, butterflies, and dung beetles in a pastoral landscape in Nicaragua. We measured species richness and abundance of these four animal taxa in riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, live fences, and pastures with high and low tree cover. We recorded over 20000 individuals of 189 species including 14 endangered bird species. Mean abundance and species richness of birds and bats, but not dung beetles or butterflies, were significantly different among forms of tree cover. Species richness of bats and birds was positively correlated with tree species richness. While the greatest numbers of bird species were associated with riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, and pastures with ¿ 15\% tree cover, the greatest numbers of bat species were found in live fences and riparian forest: Species assemblages of all animal taxa were different among tree cover types, so that maintaining a diversity of forms of tree cover led to conservation of more animal species in the landscape as a whole. Overall, the findings indicate that retaining tree cover within agricultural landscapes can help conserve animal diversity, but that conservation efforts need to target forms of tree cover that conserve the taxa that are of interest locally. Preventing the degradation of remaining forest fragments is a priority, but encouraging farmers to maintain tree cover in pastures and along boundaries may also make an important contribution to animal conservation.},

A total of 9,982 specimens were captured, belonging to the families Scarabaeidae and Trogidae, and representing 21 genera and 50 species. The genera Ataenius Harold, Onthophagus Latreille and Aphodius Illiger represented 48\% of the species of Scarabaeidae. Species richness was found to decrease with increasing altitude; there were 36 species at 1000 in asl, 27 species between 1200 and 1300 in asl, and 26 species at 1400 in asl. Abundance along the altitudinal gradient follows a pattern of few abundant species and many species with few specimens. Beetle activity is related to precipitation. In the nine communities studied, species richness was observed to increase when precipitation was greater than 100 mm at the beginning of the rainy season. On the landscape scale, there were 44 species during the rainy season, 22 during the windy nortes season, and 24 during the dry season. In terms of trophic guild, 40\% of the beetles captured were saprophagous that feed on decomposing organic material from plants and 60\% were saprophagous that feed on decomposing organic material from animals (30\% necrophagous, 26\% coprophagous, 4\% telio-necrophagous).},

	abstract = {Most dung beetles colonize the faeces of several vertebrate species without much discrimination, and are thus often considered as polyphagous. Recent studies have provided evidence for clear feeding preferences in scarab beetles colonizing dung of herbivore species, but little is known about these insects' abilities to discriminate among odours from faeces of various herbivores. In this study, trophic preferences were examined using blocks of pitfall traps baited with dung from four different herbivore species, i.e., sheep, cattle, horse, and red deer, in a mountainous area of south-central France. 4941 coprophagous scarabs, belonging to 27 species, were captured. Beetles were more attracted to dung of sheep (2257 individuals) than that of cattle (1294 individuals), followed by deer dung (768 individuals) and horse dung (622 individuals). Eleven of the 27 beetle species collected had significant feeding preferences for one of the four dung types. For each insect species, trophic habits did not vary between the two different sites of trapping, an open pasture and a wooded habitat. In laboratory olfactometer bioassays, scarab beetles orientated preferentially towards the dung volatiles from the dung type they preferred in the field. Trypocopris pyrenaeus, Anoplotrupes stercorosus, and Aphodius rufipes were more attracted to volatile compounds from sheep dung, Onthophagus fracticornis significantly preferred horse dung volatiles, and Aphodius haemorrhoidalis responded positively to deer dung odours. The role of dung olfactory cues in the process of resource selection by dung beetles is discussed.},

The survey provided a quantitative assessment of peripheral deforestation effects and an inventory for species on omnivore dung. Pitfall traps baited with pig dung were placed in both selectively logged and unlogged rainforest as well as in nearby oil palm and cacao plantations. The Ankasa forest inventory was mostly comprised of species previously trapped by human dung in the Western Upper Guinean rainforest of TO National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. However, there was relatively low species abundance similarity between the June/July assemblages on omnivore dung in Tai and Ankasa rainforests, and even lower similarity between assemblages of Ankasa and the adjacent plantations. Of 29 species recorded in Ankasa forest, most were absent or rare in plantations where assemblages were numerically dominated by species previously recorded from the West African savannas. This replacement plantation fauna showed significantly lower species richness and diversity, but significantly higher abundance, compared with Ankasa forest assemblages. The results reiterate that forest reserves are essential for the conservation of specialist rainforest dung beetle species.},

	abstract = {I compared the effectiveness of sympatric brown howlers (Alouatta guariba) and muriquis (Brachyteles arachnoides) as seed dispersers in terms of quantitative and qualitative attributes. 1 hypothesized chat differences in feeding and behavioral patterns between these large-bodied folivorous/frugivorous primates would lead to dissimilarities in their effectiveness as endozoochoric seed dispersal agents. The study was carried out in a semideciduous Forest Fragment of Fazenda Barreiro Rico, southeastern Brazil. Through behavioral sampling of frugvory and defecation events as well as analyses of fecal samples, I determined that A. guariba dispersed fewer species and produced a lower proportion Of Clung with intact seeds than B. arachnoides. There was no difference between the number of seeds in fecal samples of A. guariba and B. arachnoides. These primates affected to a similar degree both germination percentage and latency to germination of seeds they ingested or removed the pull) from. Howlers and muriquis Were also similar in carrying seeds away from the parent trees. Contrary to muriquis, howlers defecated seeds under the canopy of conspecific lianas, where seeds are expected to stiffer high mortality rates, and voided seeds predominantly in a clumped pattern. B. arachnoides was a more effective seed disperser when compared to A. guariba in some attributes evaluated, but not in others. Given the interspecific variation in recruitment patterns of tropical plants and the loss of frugivorous bird species at the study, site, rile differences between howlers and muriquis in their abilities as seed dispersers may, crucially influence the composition and maintenance of seedling diversity.},

	abstract = {The structure of the ground-dwelling beetle community at two forested sites in northern Delaware was compared by examining composition and abundance at the species or genus level for five target families and at the family level for all other Coleoptera. The beetle communities at an isolated 15-ha woodlot and a nearby plot of relatively continuous forest were sampled using pitfall traps during 2000 and 2001. The results showed an absence or reduced abundance of many beetle taxa in the isolated woodlot relative to the continuous forest site and elevated abundances of a few taxa. Most notably, the species richness of poorly dispersing species of carabid beetles was lower in the isolated woodlot, with 12 of 19 brachypterous species completely absent from pitfall samples. Although this study does not constitute a test of habitat fragmentation hypotheses, the data do suggest that the beetle community in the woodlot may be suffering from isolation effects. The estimated response to fragmentation was correlated with body size for the 19 most common carabid species caught, suggesting that body size may be a useful predictor of vulnerability to forest fragmentation. At least in Carabids, larger body size seems to be associated with greater susceptibility to fragmentation. A number of staphylinid beetle taxa were also significantly less abundant or absent in the isolated woodlot, as were some beetles in other trophic groups, including carrion beetles (Silphidae) and geotrupid beetles (Geotrupidae). Although it retains some faunal similarity with nearby continuous forest, the woodlot may be too isolated to sustain populations of some beetle taxa, especially large, poorly dispersing forest species.},

	abstract = {The conservation of biodiversity is dependent on protecting ecosystem-level processes. We investigated the effects of fragment size and habitat edge on the relative functioning of three ecological processes - decomposition, predation and regeneration of trees - in small Afromontane forests in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Ten sampling stations were placed in each of four forest categories: the interior of three large indigenous forest fragments (100 m from the edge), the edges of these large fragments, 10 small indigenous fragments (¡ 1 ha) and 10 small exotic woodlands (¡ 0.5 ha). Fragment size and edge effects did not affect the abundance of the amphipod Talitriator africana, a litter decomposer, and overall dung beetle abundance and species richness significantly. Bird egg predation was marginally greater at large patch edges compared with the other forest categories, while seed predation did not differ among forest categories. Tree seedling assemblage composition did not differ significantly among large patch interiors and edges, and small indigenous fragments. Sapling and canopy assemblage composition each differed significantly among these three indigenous forest categories. Thus, while tree recruitment was not negatively affected by patch size or distance from the edge, conditions in small fragments and at edges appear to affect the composition of advanced tree regeneration. These ecological processes in Afromontane forests appear to be resilient to fragmentation effects. We speculate that this is because the organisms in these forests have evolved under fragmented conditions. Repeated extreme changes in climate and vegetation over the Pleistocene have acted as significant distribution and ecological extinction filters on these southern hemisphere forest biota, resulting in fauna and flora that are potentially resilient to contemporary fragmentation effects. We argue that because small patches and habitat edges appear to be ecologically viable they should be included in future conservation decisions.},

	abstract = {Although insects are crucial for maintaining ecosystem function, our understanding of their overall response to human activity remains limited. This is no less true of dung-burying beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae), which provide a suite of critical ecosystem functions and services, yet but face multiple conservation threats, particularly from landscape conversion. Here we use a review and meta-analysis to synthesize the current knowledge concerning response to tropical forest modification and fragmentation of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae). For every modified habitat type and individual forest fragment across 33 studies, we calculated six dung beetle community parameters, standardized relative to intact tropical forest. We organized modified habitats along an approximate disturbance gradient ranging from selectively logged, late and early secondary forest, through agroforestry, tree plantations, to annual crops, cattle pastures and clear-cuts. Secondary forests, selectively logged forest and agroforests supported rich communities with many intact forest species, while cattle pastures and clear-cuts contained fewer species overall with few forest-dwelling species. Abundance generally declined with increasing modification, but was quite variable. Communities in open habitats were often characterized by hyper-abundance of a small number of small-bodied species, leading to low evenness. Across fragmentation studies, dung beetle species richness, abundance and evenness declined in smaller forest fragments. Richness and abundance sometimes declined in more isolated fragments, although this response appeared to depend on matrix quality. Across both habitat modification and fragmentation studies, geographic location and landscape context appeared to modify dung beetle response by influencing the available pool of colonists. We discuss potential underlying mechanisms and conclude with recommendations for management and conservation and for future research. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Dung beetles provide important ecosystem services in the habitats where they occur. The activity of dung beetles enhances soil nutrient cycling and increases the soil's ability to absorb and hold water. Consequently, these beetles are particularly important in semi-arid environments. This study analyses the importance of remaining wooded habitat patches (bushland) for the survival of a diverse dung beetle fauna in an otherwise cultivated landscape in semi-arid Tanzania. Dung beetles were sampled by pitfall trapping in maize fields and bushland habitats. In total, 6037 dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae), representing 77 species from 25 genera, were collected. Many species, particularly amongst the ball-rollers, showed a clear preference for wooded patches, species richness being significantly higher in the bushland patches than in the cultivated sites. The number of trapped specimens in bushland was also considerably higher than that found in maize fields, although the differences were not significant. In conclusion, bushland fragments appear to have an important conservation value as to maintaining a high diversity and abundance of dung beetles, thereby enhancing the ecosystem services provided by these beneficial insects.},

	abstract = {This study examines the spread of synanthropogenic dung beetles (species favoured by human activities) in pasture landscapes in Central America, and evaluates the role of forest fragments and regenerating patches of native vegetation in maintaining beetle diversity. Pitfall trapping was carried out at nine locations in El Salvador and seven in Atlantic Nicaragua that included both pasture and remnant or regenerating native vegetation. More dung beetle species occurred in forest fragments than in pastures. Community composition differed considerably between forest fragments from El Salvador and Nicaragua with many species restricted to either the Caribbean or Pacific regions. In contrast, dung beetle community composition and structure were largely the same in the pastures of El Salvador and Nicaragua, regardless of region or original habitat-type, and were similar to published results from pastures in Mexico and elsewhere on the Isthmus. Very small patches of native shrubs and tree stands (¡ 2.5 ha) maintained no forest specialists in Nicaragua, whereas, in El Salvador, some forest specialists occurred even in the smallest stands of trees (ca. 0.25 ha). The study indicates that the expansion of cattle pastures has caused a regional decline in dung beetle diversity. Forest fragments and small isolated patches of native trees and shrubs maintain some of the diversity of the original landscape but their conservation value for dung beetles will depend on the biogeographical history of the sites.},

	abstract = {Rare assemblages of woody coprolites from different strata of the Two Medicine Formation provide surprising perspectives on the feeding behavior of Late Cretaceous ornithischian dinosaurs. Most of the irregularly shaped, calcareous specimens are largely composed of fragmented conifer wood (13\%-85\%) and can be identified as coprolites by the presence of distinctive backfilled dung beetle burrows. The large size (up to 7 L in volume), fibrous contents, and associated bones and eggshell strongly suggest that the source animals at one site were Maiasaura hadrosaurs. The wood-bearing coprolites occur in strata ranging in age from similar to 74-80 Ma, revealing a recurring (possibly seasonal) habit of wood ingestion. The preponderance of wood in the specimens and the absence of recognizable small-diameter twig fragments suggest that wood ingestion was intentional-that the coprolite producers had not merely consumed wood inadvertently when feeding on the leaves and bark of terminal branches. Because undegraded wood provides inconsequential nutritive value for vertebrates, it is unlikely that ornithischians would have expended the energy to masticate intact wood for little benefit Furthermore, patterns of tissue damage in the fecal wood fragments suggest fungal degradation. Thus, the most parsimonious explanation for the high fecal wood content is that the coprolite producers consumed decomposing wood to capitalize on resources released by fungal attack, along with the tissues of the decomposers and associated invertebrate detritivores. These multiple coprolite deposits provide direct fossil evidence of recurring dinosaur diets and suggest that some ornithischians at least occasionally tapped detrital resources. Although such feeding behavior is rare in large extant herbivores, utilization of rotting wood would have augmented the resource options of Cretaceous ecosystems that lacked fodder provided by grasses and other derived angiosperms.},

	abstract = {Few relevant data are available to analyze how landscape features affect the abundance and movement patterns of tropical insects. We used mark-release-recapture techniques to study the effects of landscape structure and composition on habitat preferences and movements of Canthon cyanellus cyanellus individuals, within a complex tropical deciduous forest landscape in South Mexico during 2004 and 2005. In total, 2,460 individuals of C. c. cyanellus were captured, including 1,225 females and 1,235 males, out of which 124 individuals (65 females and 59 males) were recaptured once, and 9 individuals (seven females and two males) were recaptured twice. The abundance of individuals was equally high in large forest fragments, small forest fragments and hedgerows, but the abundance in pastures was less than half of the abundance in the other habitat types. To disentangle the movement behaviour of the species from the spatially and temporally varying sampling effort, we applied a Bayesian state-space modelling framework with a diffusion based movement model. Males showed generally faster movement rate than females, and they moved faster within forests and hedgerows than within pastures. Contrary to the assumption of the diffusion model, individuals did not move in a continuous fashion, indicated by the large fraction of individuals that were recaptured in the site of release. However, the posterior predictive data did not deviate substantially from the real data in terms of the mean and maximum movement distances recorded, and in terms of the dependence of movement distance on time between captures. Our results suggest that an important component of the biota in Mexican agro-pasture landscapes can utilize contemporary landscape elements such as hedgerows or small forest fragments in addition to large fragments of remnant habitat. These habitats are still locally common in semi-natural ecosystems and require less intensive conservation management.},

	abstract = {We analyzed changes over time in species composition and functional guild structure (temporal beta diversity) for natural assemblages and those modified by humans in a fragmented, tropical mountain landscape. The assemblages belong to cloud forests (the original vegetation type), secondary forests, traditional shaded coffee plantations, commercial shaded coffee plantations, and a cattle pasture. Copronecrophagous beetles, subfamily Scarabaeinae (Insecta: Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), were used as the indicator group. This group has been used in previous studies and other tropical forests and has been found to be a good indicator of the effects of anthropogenic change. For each assemblage, we compared samples that were collected several years apart. Changes were found in species composition, order of abundance, and in the proportion that a given species is present in the different functional groups. The changes that occurred between samplings affected the less abundant species in the cloud forest and in the pasture. In the other vegetation types, both abundant and less abundant species were affected. Their order of abundance and proportion in the different guilds also changed. This study shows that, although landscape richness remains relatively constant, richness at the local level (alpha diversity) changes notably even over short lapses of time. This could be a characteristic of landscapes with intermediate degrees of disturbance (such as those that have been partially modified for human use), where assemblage composition is very fluid.},

These fragments have existed for 150 years and possibly millennia. Using pit-fall traps to capture dung beetles, we investigated fragment area, fragment isolation, and tree density in fragments as predictors of species richness, abundance, and biomass of dung beetles. Across six fragments, isolation distance was negatively related with dung beetle species richness, while all other variables were unrelated. We also examined the abundance of the dominant species using flight-intercept traps in 21 fragments. Tree density correlated negatively with abundance of the dominant species, a probable new species.},

	volume = {81},
	issn = {0716-078X},
	abstract = {At the Maulino forest, herbivory upon Aristotelia chilensis (maqui) is negatively affected by forest fragmentation, being higher in the continuous forest than in the small remnant fragments, particularly at the beginning of the growing season (spring). This phenomenon may be attributable to changes in the population dynamics of herbivores, mostly insects. In this work, the effect of the Maulino forest fragmentation on the abundance, species richness and composition of nocturnal defoliating insects associated with A. chilensis was evaluated. The insects associated with A. chilensis were sampled monthly, between August 2005 and February 2006, in 32 trees located in a continuous forest (600 ha) and in 32 trees located in eight forest fragments (0.4-20 ha). Insect sampling was carried out during the first five night hours. 890 folivorous insects from 17 families and 77 species of Coleoptera, Orthoptera and Lepidoptera were collected. All species were native. The total abundance did not vary with habitat fragmentation. Nevertheless, some species increased their abundance with fragmentation, while others were depressed. The species richness of folivorous insects per tree did not vary with forest fragmentation, though the total number of species was considerably higher in the forest fragments. The species similarity was higher within the continuous forest than between the continuous forest and fragments or among fragments. At the beginning of the season (September), the abundance of Sericoides obesa was significantly higher in the continuous forest than in the forest fragments. Later in the season, Sericoides viridis became more abundant in the forest fragments. Because of the body size and the voracity of Sericoides sp., these insects seem to be responsible of the herbivory patterns of A. chilensis at the Maulino forest.},

	abstract = {To understand how current patterns of habitat loss and fragmentation will ultimately affect ecosystem functioning, we need to match experimental manipulations of community structure with real changes occurring in the landscapes of today. In this study, we examine the consequences of habitat fragmentation on a key function: the decomposition of dung by invertebrates. In a microcosm experiment, we use previous observations of dung beetle assemblage structure in fragmented and intact landscapes to create realistic differences in assemblages of small, dung-dwelling species in the genus Aphodius. We ask whether such differences will affect ecosystem functioning, and how their effects compare to those of removing full functional groups: dung-dwelling Aphodius, tunnelling Geotrupes stercorarius, and/or earthworms. As measured by changes in dung fresh weight, we observe an overriding impact of removing G. stercorarius, with the amount of dung remaining at any one time doubling if the species is excluded. Compared to this major effect, there seem to be less effects of removing Aphodius, ambiguous effects of excluding earthworms, and no detectable effects of relatively minor changes in Aphodius assemblages as induced by current levels of fragmentation. Overall, our results support the general notion that different species contribute highly unevenly to overall ecosystem functioning. Most importantly though, our findings suggest that the functional consequences of habitat loss will depend on taxon-specific responses to landscape modification. Only by addressing these responses may we predict the actual consequences of habitat loss.},

	abstract = {We studied the diversity of dung beetles in three different habitats in the Lacandona Forest, Chiapas, Mexico. We found a total of 49 species. Of these, 44 were in well-preserved forests (SC) within the limits of the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, 42 in fragmented forests (SF), and 13 in cattle pastures (PZ). These two latter habitats were part of a fragmented landscape. Even though the species richness between the two forest habitats is similar, there is a change in guild composition and structure. About 12\% of the species were exclusively found in SC, while 4.1\% and 2\% were exclusive of SF and PZ respectively. beta diversity was the most important element for overall diversity (gamma), above that of the local richness (alpha). Within well-preserved forests, species composition changes substantially, even among neighboring sites. Species diversity within the landscape seems to depend on canopy coverage, soil temperature and geographic distance between sites. Functional groups vary with the habitat. Large-bodied, nocturnal species with specific requirements of soil temperature and compaction are more sensitive to anthropogenic changes. In cattle pastures there is a larger number of heliophilic species, with a higher percentage of small-bodied and roller beetles.},

	abstract = {1. To provide reliable tools for landscape management in tropical regions, it is important to recognise the emergent properties of landscape heterogeneity and to understand their influence on different components of biodiversity. 2. The effects of habitat type, patch size and shape, canopy cover, distance between habitats, and elevation were examined on the partitioned diversity (alpha, beta and gamma) of dung beetles in a transformed landscape in southern Mexico. 3. In total, 4109 individuals belonging to 28 species of dung beetle were recorded in the entire landscape. Alpha diversity was similar among habitats, although species composition was more similar between forest remnants and living fences than between living fences and pastures. Beta diversity was related to differences in elevation and distance between habitats. The distance between fragments was significantly correlated with the mean number of beetle captures and species richness per site. Gamma diversity depended more on species turnover (beta diversity) than on local species richness. 4. In general, living fences and pastures with trees, and small forest patches retain a significant proportion of the fauna typically associated with pristine forest habitats. The remaining tracts of forest, along with the contemporary landscape elements may offer suitable habitats for future recolonisation by other insect species in heavily disturbed landscapes in tropical Mexico.},

	abstract = {Frugivores, as seed dispersers may influence the spatial patterns of adult and juvenile plants, but a large portion of the potential recruitment of plant populations is lost to seed predators. The majority of seeds dispersed by primates are killed by seed predators or moved by secondary dispersers. Little is known about post-dispersal seed-predation and seedling distribution of exploited plant species. This study iinvestigated the survival and establishment of seedlings from seeds defecated by the golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia), a frugivorous endemic primate of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Two groups of golden lion tamarins were studied in the Uniao Biological Reserve from April 2003 to March 2004. Seeds from fruits consumed by tamarins and collected from their feces were evaluated with respect to the following: germination success, seed disappearance or secondary dispersal on the forest floor, seed predation, and seedling establishment and survival for the length of the study period. The tamarin groups consumed 88 fruit species. Of these, 38 were used to run 107 experiments which indicated that more than 50\% of the seeds disappeared, about 15\% died before germinating and seeds of 22 species reached the seedling stage. At the end of the study, only 15 of these species still had surviving seedlings. Studies on seed fate are important for understanding the role of the golden lion tamarind in the natural process of forest regeneration in the lowland Atlantic Forest of the state of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.},

	abstract = {Many taxa, including dung beetles, exhibit small-scale microendemism in Madagascar, which has contributed to the high level of species' diversity on the island. Species in the genus Nanos are numerically dominant in the dung beetle communities in rainforests in eastern Madagascar, but typically just one species occurs in any one locality. The two northern species, N. clypeatus and N. dubitatus, cannot be distinguished by either a mitochondrial or a nuclear genetic marker (cytochrome oxidase subunit I and internal transcription spacer 2). One population of the southern N. viettei is genetically highly divergent, although morphologically indistinguishable. Genetic data indicate that introgression occurred from N. dubitatus to N. viettei 1-2 Mya, and these species may continue to hybridize. Complex genetic patterns have mostly evolved within the last 2 Myr. During this time, the glacial cycles in the northern hemisphere were reflected in the oscillating climatic conditions in Africa, which repeatedly fragmented and re-united the rainforests in eastern Madagascar, possibly leading to the observed complex phylogeographical patterns in Nanos.

	abstract = {We evaluated the importance of small (¡ 5 ha) forest patches for the conservation of regional plant diversity in the tropical rainforest of Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. We analyzed the density of plant species (number of species per 0.1 ha) in 45 forest patches of different sizes (1-700 ha) in 3 landscapes with different deforestation levels (4, 11, and 24\% forest cover). Most of the 364 species sampled (360 species, 99\%) were native to the region, and only 4 (1\%) were human-introduced species. Species density in the smallest patches was high and variable; the highest (84 species) and lowest (23 species) number of species were recorded in patches of up to 1.8 ha. Despite the small size of these patches, they contained diverse communities of native plants, including endangered and economically important species. The relationship between species density and area was significantly different among the landscapes, with a significant positive slope only in the landscape with the highest deforestation level. This indicates that species density in a patch of a given size may vary among landscapes that have different deforestation levels. Therefore, the conservation value of a patch depends on the total forest cover remaining in the landscape. Our findings revealed, however, that a great portion of regional plant diversity was located in very small forest patches (¡ 5 ha), most of the species were restricted to only a few patches (41\% of the species sampled were distributed in only 1-2 patches, and almost 70\% were distributed in 5 patches) and each landscape conserved a unique plant assemblage. The conservation and restoration of small patches is therefore necessary to effectively preserve the plant diversity of this strongly deforested and unique Neotropical region.},

	abstract = {Very little is known about the diversity of arthropods in the fast-disappearing fragments of natural forests in sub-Saharan Africa. This study investigated: (1) the influence of forest fragment characteristics on dung beetle species richness, composition, abundance, and diversity; and (2) the relationship between dung beetle assemblages and rainfall pattern. Beetles were sampled through 12 mo using dung baited pitfall traps. A total of 18,073 dung beetles belonging to three subfamilies and 45 species were captured. The subfamily Scarabaeinae was the most abundant (99\%) and species rich (89\%). Fast-burying tunnellers (paracoprids) were the most dominant functional group. Catharsius sesostris, Copris nepos, and Heliocopris punctiventris were the three most abundant species, and had the highest contributions to dissimilarities between forests. With few exceptions, dung beetle abundance, species richness, and diversity were generally higher in larger forest fragments (100-150 ha) than in smaller ones (10-50 ha) and the nature reserve (1042 ha). Forest fragment size had a highly significant positive relationship with beetle abundance, but only when the nature reserve is excluded in the analysis. Dung beetle abundance and species richness showed direct weak relationships with litter depth (positive) and groundcover (negative) but not tree density, tree species richness, and fragment isolation distance. Dung beetle abundance and species richness were strongly correlated with monthly changes in rainfall. Results of this study indicate that forest fragments on agricultural lands in the Budongo landscape, especially medium-sized (100-150 ha) ones, represent important conservation areas for dung beetles.},

	abstract = {This study examines the effects of deforestation, and the habitat value of coffee and regenerated forest for tropical dung beetles, a functionally significant insect group. Pitfall trapping was conducted at 22 sites in a montane region of central Peru during April and November/December of 2002. Sites included primary and secondary forest, shade-coffee, regenerated forest and open farms (mainly with banana, yuca, and corn). Ordination techniques indicated that beetle assemblages in forests, regenerated forest and coffee were relatively similar. However, assemblage compositions in forested areas differed even at similar altitudes under the influence of biogeographical factors, and the assemblages at disturbed sites (farms/coffee) were influenced by beetle dispersal from adjacent forests. During dry months, when beetle activity is low, communities at all habitat types tended to converge because fewer unique species were recorded in forests at that time and habitat/season generalists were dominant. Preliminary results also indicate that beetles in shady crops such as bananas responded to plant growth: as the banana canopy closed-in, producing more shade, open-habitat specialists retreated and forest/shade specialists invaded the sites. Chronosequence data at two of the sites demonstrate the rapid and dramatic changes in species richness and assemblage composition caused by deforestation. As forests become increasingly fragmented, and open farms continue to expand, dung beetles will become more restricted to the remaining fragments and reserves. In the mosaic landscape studied here, shade crops, like coffee, act as habitat and corridors for many dung beetle species. Small farm size and the consequent magnitude of edge effects, likely contributed to beetle movement between habitat types and determined the apparent generalist nature of many of the dung beetle species in this study.},

	abstract = {The reconstruction and structure of the European Holocene “wildwood” has been the focus of considerable academic debate. The ability of palaeoecological data and particularly pollen analysis to accurately reflect the density of wildwood canopy has also been widely discussed. Fossil insects, as a proxy for vegetation and landscape structure, provide a potential approach to address this argument. Here,we present a review and re-analysis of 36 early and mid-Holocene (9500-2000 cal BC) sub-fossil beetle assemblages from Britain, examining percentage values of tree, open ground and dung beetles as well as tree host data to gain an insight into vegetation structure, the role of grazing animals in driving such structure and establish independently the importance of different types of trees and associated shading in the early Holocene “wildwood”. Open indicator beetle species are persistently present over the entire review period. although they fluctuate in importance. During the early Holocene (9500-6000 cal BC) these indicators are initially high, at levels which are not dissimilar to modern data from pasture woodland. However, during the latter stages of this and the next period, 6000-4000 cal BC, open ground and pasture indicators decline and are generally low compared with previously. Alongside this pattern, we see woodland indicators generally increase in importance, although there are significant local fluctuations. Levels of dung beetles are mostly low over these periods, with some exceptions to this pattern, especially towards the end of the Mesolithic and in floodplain areas. Host data associated with the fossil beetles indicate that trees associated with lighter canopy conditions such as oak, pine, hazel and birch are indeed important components of the tree canopy during the earlier Holocene (c. 9500-6000 cal BC), in accordance with much of the current pollen literature. Beetles associated with more shade-tolerant trees (such as lime and elm) become more frequent in the middle Holocene (6000-4000 cal BC) suggesting that at this stage the woodland canopy was less open than previously, although open ground and pasture areas appear to have persisted in some locations. The onset of agriculture (4000-2000 cal BC) coincides with significant fluctuations in woodland composition and taxa. This is presumably as a result of human impact, although here there are significant regional variations. There are also increases in the amounts of open ground represented and especially in the levels of dung beetles present in faunas, suggesting there is a direct relationship between the activities of grazing animals and the development of more open areas. One of the most striking aspects of this review is the variable nature of the landscape suggested by the palaeoecological data, particularly but not exclusively with the onset of agriculture: some earlier sites indicate high variability between levels of tree-associated species on the one hand and the open ground beetle fauna on the other, indicating that in some locations, open areas were of local significance and can be regarded as important features of the Holocene landscape. The role of grazing animals in creating these areas of openness was apparently minimal until the onset of the Neolithic. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Five habitat types were compared: secondary forest fragments, organic shade coffee and cocoa plantations, corn fields and active pastures. Ants were captured by tuna baiting following standardised protocols. Species richness and diversity decreased along the gradient from forest to the pasture, and each of the agricultural systems (cocoa, coffee and corn plantations) significantly differed in diversity. Species composition also differed along the disturbance gradient, as shown by multivariate analysis. Forest and pasture were at the extremes of the gradient and shared no common species. The ant assemblages associated with coffee plots, although poorer in species, were more similar to those of the forest than to those of the cocoa plantations. The observed trends confirm that shaded agro-forestry plantations can help to maintain high biodiversity levels in tropical landscapes.},

	abstract = {Do live fences help conserve butterfly diversity in agricultural landscapes? In Central America, natural forests have been transformed into agriculture production areas, generating forest fragmentation, desertification, erosion and loss of biodiversity, among other concerns. Different tree cover compositions are kept on these agricultural landscapes, including scattered trees in pastures, live fences, fragments of secondary forests, and riparian forests. These can help in biodiversity conservation because they generate shelter, feeding and reproduction areas, among others. We studied the composition, richness and abundance of diurnal butterflies on two types of live fences in a landscape where pastures are predominant in Costa Rica's Central Pacific Region. Transects (120x5m) were observed for an hour (two days/habitat) in five multi-strata fences (with several plant species, strata and canopy width) and five simple fences (with smaller and pruned trees). A total of 2 782 butterflies were observed (75 species). The most abundant species were Anartia fatima, Eurema daria, Eurema nise, Hermeuptychia hermes, Junonia evarete and Phoebis philea. Multi-strata fences had more species and can help maintain 56\% of the total species observed in secondary and riparian forests. This type of live fence can play an important role in butterfly conservation in livestock areas, and its benefits are influenced by the manner in which farmers manage their land. Rev. Biol.

	abstract = {Seasonal and spatial species richness variation of dung beetles (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae s. str.) in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. The knowledge on Atlantic Forest scarab beetle fauna is quite limited. This biome is strongly degraded and these insects can be used as bioindicators since they are sensitive to forest destruction and show distinct organizational patterns in forest fragments or in areas that have been deteriorated by human activity. Thus, a study of the Scarabaeidae (sensu stricto) dung beetles fauna that inhabit Serra do Japi, Sao Paulo, Brazil (23 degrees 12'-23 degrees 22' S and 46 degrees 53'-47 degrees 03'W) was carried out: the monthly species richness was analyzed in six areas during one year and the vegetation's Structural physiognomy was described. The areas included a conserved and it degraded valley, a northward and a southward hillside, it hilltop, and an area of secondary forest growing under eucalyptus trees. The specimens were collected using four pitfall traps baited with human feces, which remained at each spot during 48 hours. Between September, 1997 and August, 1998, 3524 individuals of 39 species were collected; the most abundant were: Canthidium trinodosum, Eurysternus cyanescens, Uroxys kratochvili, Scybalocanthon nigriceps, Uroxys lata, Canthonella sp., Dichotomius assifer. Deltochilum furcatum, Canthidium sp.2, Canthon latipes, Deltochilum rubripenne, Eurysternus sp., and Dichotomius sp.1. The number of individuals and species was greater in the hot, rainy season, when there was a correlation between the number of species and the mean annual temperature [r(2)= 0.69; p¡0.01]. The lower winter richness was most pronounced in the conserved valley, while richness remained relatively constant in the degraded valley; abundance was much higher in the degraded valley. The cluster analysis showed that the valleys and hillsides are the most similar in relation to species composition and abundance, yet different front the secondary forest with eucalypts and the hilltop.},

	abstract = {Many studies have evaluated the effect of forest fragmentation on dung beetle assemblage structure. However, few have analyzed how forest fragmentation affects the processes carried out by these insects in tropical forests where their food sources consist mainly of dung produced by native herbivore mammals. With the conversion of forests to pastures, cattle dung has become an exotic alternative and abundant food for dung beetles. This study compares dung removal rates of native (monkey) and exotic (cow) dung in different-sized fragments of tropical rain forests, during the dry and rainy seasons at the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve. Dung removal rates were affected by season, dung type, and the interaction between resource type and season. During the dry season, the removal rates of monkey dung were somewhat similar than during the rainy season, whereas the removal rates of cow dung were much higher during the rainy season. Dung beetle biomass and species richness were almost three times greater in monkey dung than in cow dung. Monkey dung attracted species belonging to the dweller, roller, and tunneler guilds; cow dung attracted mostly tunnelers. Therefore, the use of exotic dung may result in a biased misconception of the rates of dung removal in tropical forest and an underestimation of dung beetle diversity. This study highlights the importance of working with natural tropical forest resources when attempting to identify realistic tendencies concerning processes in natural habitats and those modified by fragmentation and by other human activities.},

	abstract = {Understanding how biodiversity is partitioned among alternative land-uses is an important first step for developing effective conservation plans in multiple-use landscapes. Here, we analysed nestedness patterns of species composition for nine different taxonomic groups [dung beetles, fruit-feeding butterflies, orchid bees, scavenger flies, leaf-litter amphibians, lizards, bats, birds and woody plants (trees and lianas)] in a multiple-use forestry landscape in the Brazilian Amazon containing primary, secondary and Eucalyptus plantation forests. A formal nestedness analysis was performed to investigate whether species-poor land-uses were comprised of a subset of species from more diverse forests, and the extent to which this pattern varied among taxa. At the landscape-scale the species-by-sites matrices were significantly nested for all nine taxonomic groups when both sites and species were sorted to maximally pack the species/occurrence matrix and, except for orchid bees when sorted by land-use intensity (primary forest to Eucalyptus plantation). Different patterns emerged when we conducted pairwise analyses of nestedness between the three forest types: (a) most of the taxonomic groups were nested in accordance with increased land-use intensity; (b) neither orchid bees nor leaf-litter amphibians from secondary forest made up a significant nested subset of primary forest species, although species found in Eucalyptus plantation sites were nested within secondary forest communities; and (c) lizards from Eucalyptus plantations were not a nested subset of either primary or secondary forest. Our findings emphasize the complex nature of patterns of species occupancy in tropical multiple-use forestry landscapes, and illustrate that there may be no easy solutions to questions regarding the conservation value of secondary and exotic plantation forests.

	abstract = {Grazing is one of the key processes in terrestrial ecosystems and this can be provided by both indigenous and domestic ungulates. However, a question remains whether or not traditional forms of land use such as the grazing of domestic animals support the maintenance of biodiversity. If it does not, then the second question becomes to what extent does grazing of domestic animals alter the systems and processes that support biodiversity? This study demonstrates that in attempting to answer this question, small organisms like dung beetles are ideal indicators that can be used to express significant differences between conserved (indigenous) and non-conserved (domestic) land. As a general trend, studies that investigated these differences displayed differences through analysis of the diversity indices. This method has in most cases demonstrated a lack of contrast between conserved and non-conserved land. In the existence of such uncertainty this study has demonstrated that in such cases, where the analysis of biodiversity indices fail to demonstrate significant differences a closer examination of actual species such as guilds and functional groups could confirm significant differences between conserved and non-conserved land. These apparently conflicting findings reflect the need to consider the actual elements of biodiversity (e.g. species) when assessing conservation issues rather than just the statistical measures of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Monitoring rare and elusive species for effective management and conservation is particularly challenging and often demands the development of specialized techniques. Scat surveys have been applied to monitor a variety of rare species but relatively little attention has been given to the development of appropriate sampling designs. To determine if scat surveys could be applied to compare the distribution of species across three habitats of a fragmented region in the Brazilian Amazon, the removal of human (n=27) and jaguar (n=27) scat samples in forest, riparian corridor and pasture habitats was recorded for 24 hours. Dung beetles were responsible for removing the majority of samples (71\%) and a generalized linear mixed effect model revealed significant influence of habitat and scat type on removal probability, with forest and riparian corridors having higher removal compared with samples in pasture habitats. Although non-invasive scat surveys can potentially address fundamental broad-scale conservation and management questions, our results demonstrate that scat surveys in the tropics must account for differences in scat removal rates between habitats and target species before conclusions can be drawn regarding patterns of habitat use.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.biocon.2010.08.011},
	abstract = {A key challenge for tropical conservation biologists is to assess how forest management practices affect biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions. Dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) provide an ideal focal guild for such studies. We compared dung beetle assemblages and experimentally assessed rates of dung removal and seed burial in undisturbed forest, low-intensity selectively logged forest under sustainable forest management, and high-intensity logged forest, not under sustainable management in Malaysian Borneo. In total, 7923 individuals from 39 species of dung beetle were collected. There were no significant differences in abundance, biomass or diversity across sites. Species richness was significantly lower in the high-intensity logged sites. Beta diversity was low: of 35 species recorded in undisturbed forest sites, 32 were also captured in low-intensity sites and 29 in high-intensity sites. The environmental and vegetation variables measured had little influence on species composition. An average of 63-99\% of dung was removed over 24 h. Mean dung and seed removal were significantly lower in the high-intensity logged sites. Dung removal rates were significantly and positively correlated with dung beetle species richness, but not with dung beetle biomass or abundance. However, the biomass of large-bodied, nocturnal dung beetles was positively correlated with dung removal. In contrast to previous studies, dung beetle biomass and abundance were not correlated with species richness, indicative of density compensation. Overall, dung beetle communities and associated ecosystem functions were robust to low-intensity but not high-intensity selective logging. These differences may be related to changes in the abundance and biomass of particular dung beetle species or guilds rather than community-wide measures of abundance and biomass, highlighting the need to move beyond simplistic biodiversity-ecosystem functioning correlations to understand the functional consequences of habitat modification in high-diversity ecosystems.

	abstract = {The study was conducted at the Mata dos Godoy State Park in Londrina, state of Parana, Brazil. Baited pitfall traps were installed in the forest, in adjacent abandoned pasture land, and on the borders between these two environments. Every two weeks, from June 1999 to May 2000, the traps were placed for 24 hours and the material was collected every 12 hours. The 4687 specimens of Scarabaeinae collected belong to 13 genera and 27 species. The most frequent species were Onthophagus catharinensis (Paulian, 1936) (22.1\%), Onthophagus hirculus (Mannerhein, 1829) (20.1\%), Dichotomius mormon (Ljungh, 1799) (13.1\%), Sulcophanaeus menelas (Laporte, 1840) (12.8\%), and Eurystemus parallelus (Dalman, 1824) (10.6\%). The other species collected amounted to less than 4.7\%. The difference in numbers of specimens collected in the three environments was not significant (K-(2.72) = 0.63, p = 0.729). The distribution patterns of species composition for the different environments (ANOSIM R = 0.29, p ¡ 0.01) and activity periods (ANOSIM R = 0.18, p ¡ 0.01) were different. Sulcophanaeus menelas, Canthidium aff. trinodosum, O. hirculus, and E. parallelus were the most abundant species, being predominantly diurnal; the first three species were more active on abandoned pasture. Most of the Dichothomius assifer(Eschscholtz, 1822) and D. mormon specimens were captured at night. The latter species was the most abundant in edges, whereas D. assifer, Scybalochantum aff. zischkai, and O. catharinensis can be considered bioindicators because they were either exclusively or highly predominant in the best preserved areas. A larger number of individuals was observed from December 1999 through March 2000, which is the time of the year when adults of Scarabaeinae normally emerge and fly, in the studied region. The highest diversity (88.89\%) was observed in February.},

	abstract = {P¿1. The future of tropical forest species depends in part on their ability to survive in human-modified landscapes. Forest strips present a priority area for biodiversity research because they are a common feature of many managed landscapes, are often afforded a high level of legal protection, and can provide a cost-effective and politically acceptable conservation strategy. 2. Despite the potential conservation benefits that could be provided by forest strips, ecologists currently lack sufficient evidence to inform policy and guide their design and management. 3. We used a quasi-experimental landscape in the Brazilian Amazon to test the importance of four management-relevant variables (forest type, isolation distance, forest structure, and large mammal activity) on the potential biodiversity conservation value of narrow forest strips for dung beetles. 4. Information-theoretic model selection based on AICc revealed strong support for the influence of large mammal activity and forest type on dung beetle abundance; isolation distance on species richness; and forest structure on the relative abundance of matrix-tolerant species. Multi-dimensional scaling showed a strong influence of forest type and isolation on community composition and structure, with riparian and dry-land strips having complementary sets of species. 5. Synthesis and applications. To enhance the conservation value and ecological integrity of forest strips in human-modified landscapes we recommend that strip design considers both isolation distance and whether or not the strips encompass perennial streams. In addition, we identify the maintenance of forest structure and the protection of large mammal populations as being crucially important for conserving forest dung beetle communities.},

Dung beetles were sampled in 15 plots from three different successional stages in both wet and dry seasons. We sampled a total of 2,752 individuals, representing 38 beetle species and 14 genera. The composition, richness, and abundance of dung beetles changed along the successional gradient and was strongly related to seasonal variation. The highest diversity of dung beetles was found in the intermediate aged forest fragments. These findings highlight the importance of secondary forests to biodiversity conservation and restoration programs in seasonally dry tropical ecosystems.},

	abstract = {We synthesize findings to date from the world's largest and longest-running experimental study of habitat fragmentation, located in central Amazonia. Over the past 32 years, Amazonian forest fragments ranging from 1 to 100 ha have experienced a wide array of ecological changes. Edge effects have been a dominant driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage, fauna, and other aspects of fragment ecology. However, edge-effect intensity varies markedly in space and time, and is influenced by factors such as edge age, the number of nearby edges, and the adjoining matrix of modified vegetation surrounding fragments. In our study area, the matrix has changed markedly over the course of the study (evolving from large cattle pastures to mosaics of abandoned pasture and regrowth forest) and this in turn has strongly influenced fragment dynamics and faunal persistence. Rare weather events, especially windstorms and droughts, have further altered fragment ecology. In general, populations and communities of species in fragments are hyperdynamic relative to nearby intact forest. Some edge and fragment-isolation effects have declined with a partial recovery of secondary forests around fragments, but other changes: such as altered patterns of tree recruitment, are ongoing. Fragments are highly sensitive to external vicissitudes, and even small changes in local land-management practices may drive fragmented ecosystems in markedly different directions. The effects of fragmentation are likely to interact synergistically with other anthropogenic threats such as logging, hunting, and especially fire, creating an even greater peril for the Amazonian biota.

	abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation have turned into the most important threats to biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide. Here we investigate the effects of habitat fragmentation and drastic changes in tree communities on dung beetle richness and community structure. This study was carried out in a severely fragmented 670-km(2) forest landscape of the Atlantic Forest of north-eastern Brazil. Sampling was carried out in 19 forest fragments between September 2007 and March 2008 with the use of pitfall traps and flight interception traps. A total of 5893 individuals and 30 species of dung beetle were collected. Fragment area and isolation were the most significant explanatory variables for predictable and conspicuous changes in dung beetle species richness. Smaller and isolated fragments presented lower number of species, but fragments with lower tree species richness and lower proportion of shade-tolerant species were also considerably impoverished in terms of dung beetle species richness. The body mass of dung beetles were explained by fragment area and the percentage of emergent trees with smaller and less stratified fragments being dominated by small-bodied dung beetles. An ordination analysis segregated dung beetle communities between small fragments (¡ 100 ha) and the control area. Seventy-seven percent of the species were recorded in the control area and 22\% of all species were unique to this habitat. Our findings indicate that large fragments in the Atlantic Forest appear to consist in a sort of irreplaceable habitats for particular groups of dung beetle species, as well as for the integrity of their communities.

	abstract = {The loss of biodiversity caused by human activity is assumed to alter ecosystem functioning. However our understanding of the magnitude of the effect of these changes on functional diversity and their impact on the dynamics of ecological processes is still limited. We analyzed the functional diversity of copro-necrophagous beetles under different conditions of land use in three Mexican biosphere reserves. In Montes Azules pastures, forest fragments and continuous rainforest were analyzed, in Los Tuxtlas rainforest fragments of different sizes were analyzed and in Barranca de Metztitlan two types of xerophile scrub with different degrees of disturbance from grazing were analyzed. We assigned dung beetle species to functional groups based on food relocation, beetle size, daily activity period and food preferences, and as measures of functional diversity we used estimates based on multivariate methods. In Montes Azules functional richness was lower in the pastures than in continuous rainforest and rainforest fragments, but fragments and continuous forest include functionally redundant species. In small rainforest fragments (¡ 5 ha) in Los Tuxtlas, dung beetle functional richness was lower than in large rainforest fragments (¿ 20 ha). Functional evenness and functional dispersion did not vary among habitat types or fragment size in these reserves. In contrast, in Metztitlan, functional richness and functional dispersion were different among the vegetation types, but differences were not related to the degree of disturbance by grazing. More redundant species were found in submontane than in crassicaule scrub. For the first time, a decrease in the functional diversity in communities of copro-necrophagous beetles resulting from changes in land use is documented, the potential implications for ecosystem functioning are discussed and a series of variables that could improve the evaluation of functional diversity for this biological group is proposed.},

	abstract = {Aim Using dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) in a tropical land-bridge island system, we test for the small island effect (SIE) in the species-area relationship and evaluate its effects on species richness and community composition. We also examine the determinants of species richness across island size and investigate the traits of dung beetle species in relation to their local extinction vulnerability following forest fragmentation. Location Lake Kenyir, a hydroelectric reservoir in north-eastern Peninsular Malaysia. Methods We sampled dung beetles using human dung baited pitfall traps on 24 land-bridge islands and three mainland sites. We used regression tree analyses to test for the SIE, as well as species traits related to local rarity, as an indication of extinction vulnerability. We employed generalized linear models (GLMs) to examine determinants for species richness at different scales and compared the results with those from conventional linear and breakpoint regressions. Community analyses included non-metric multidimensional scaling, partial Mantel tests, nestedness analysis and abundance spectra. Results Regression tree analysis revealed an area threshold at 35.8 ha indicating an SIE. Tree basal area was the most important predictor of species richness on small islands (¡ 35.8 ha). Results from GLMs supported these findings, with isolation and edge index also being important for small islands. The SIE also manifested in patterns of dung beetle community composition where communities on small islands (¡ 35.8 ha) departed from those on the mainland and larger islands, and were highly variable with no significant nestedness, probably as a result of unexpected species occurrences on several small islands. The communities exhibited a low degree of spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that dispersal limitation plays a part in structuring dung beetle assemblages. Species with lower baseline density and an inability to forage on the forest edge were found to be rarer among sites and hence more prone to local extinction. Main conclusions We highlight the stochastic nature of dung beetle community composition on small islands and argue that this results in reduced ecosystem functionality. A better understanding of the minimum fragment size required for retaining functional ecological communities will be important for effective conservation management and the maintenance of tropical forest ecosystem stability.},

	doi = {10.1603/EN10203},
	abstract = {Many studies have analyzed the effect of forest fragmentation on dung beetle diversity in tropical landscapes. Few of them, however, have analyzed how forest fragmentation affects the assemblage structure of necrophagous beetles and their removal rates of carrion in tropical forests. This study compares the effect of the time of the day in which carrion is offered to dung beetles (in the morning or at night) on the rates of carrion removal over time (12, 24, and 36 h) in tropical rain forest fragments of different sizes. Fragment size, time, and carrion offer had no effect on carrion removal rates in this study, but these factors affected abundance and species richness of necrophagous beetles. Carrion removal was the highest 12 h after the carrion had been offered. The average rate per hour of carrion removal in all fragments after 12 h was 4.47 g/h, after 24 h was 3.27 g/h, and 36 h later 2.64 g/h. Carrion removal rates are likely to be affected by beetle abundance and species richness. The most abundant species captured when carrion was offered at night was Coprophanaeus telamon Harold, a nocturnal necrophagous tunneler beetle. When carrion was offered in the morning, the most abundant species was the diurnal copro-necrophagous roller beetle Canthon cyanellus LeConte. Large nocturnal tunneler beetles were only found in large fragments, but small diurnal roller species were abundant in both large and small fragments. Our results suggest that different species contribute unevenly in different ways to carrion removal in tropical forest fragments. Carrion removal is not affected by fragment size per se, but by the fragmentation process.},

	abstract = {The probability and pattern of secondary seed dispersal by dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) depend on their community structure and composition at the site of primary deposition, which, in turn, seem to be strongly determined by vegetation. Consequently, we expected pronounced differences in secondary seed dispersal between forest and savanna in the northern Ivory Coast, West Africa. We found 99 dung beetle species at experimentally exposed dung piles of the olive baboon (Papio anubis (Lesson, 1827)), an important primary seed disperser in West Africa. Seventy-six species belonged to the roller and tunneler guilds, which are relevant for secondary seed dispersal. Most species showed a clear habitat preference. Contrary to the Neotropics, species number and abundance were much higher in the savanna than in the forest. Rollers and tunnelers each accounted for approximately 50\% of the individuals in the savanna, but in the forest rollers made up only 4\%. Seeds deposited into the savanna by an omnivorous primary disperser generally have a higher overall probability of being more rapidly dispersed secondarily by dung beetles than seeds in the forest. Also, rollers disperse seeds over larger distances. In contrast to other studies, small rollers were active in dispersal of large seeds, which were seemingly mistaken for dung balls. Our results suggest that rollers can remove seeds from any plant dispersed in primate dung in this ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Seeds of many plant species are secondarily dispersed by dung beetles, but the outcome of this interaction is highly context-specific. Little is known about how certain anthropogenic disturbances affect this plantanimal interaction. The aims of this study were to assess the effect of dung type on secondary dispersal by dung beetles in a forest fragment, and to determine whether this interaction is affected by edge effects. Using pitfall traps, we captured dung beetles attracted to dung of 2 frugivorous mammals: woolly monkeys and howler monkeys. We found differences between both dung beetle assemblages, but these differences were not consistent in time. Using seeds surrounded by both dung types, we carried out a field experiment using seeds of 2 plant species. We found that the probability of secondary dispersal by dung beetles was higher for seeds placed in woolly monkey dung. Finally, we carried out a field experiment using plastic beads as seed mimics to assess edge effects. We found that secondary seed dispersal by dung beetles was negatively affected by edges. The disruption of plantanimal interactions along anthropogenic forest edges could have long-term negative effects on forest dynamics by affecting processes of regeneration.},

	abstract = {Dung beetles are important to healthy cattle pasture ecosystems as they provide for nutrient recycling, removal of waste products from the soil surface and assist in the reduction of pestiferous flies. Numerous exotic dung beetles have been accidentally or intentionally introduced to the North American continent and several of these have become established. We surveyed for the presence and distribution of dung beetles on four cattle farms in north central Florida over a 3.5-yr period using cattle dung-baited pitfall traps placed at least every 3 wk. In total, 39 species from 20 genera were identified with a total of 62,320 beetles collected in traps. Although none were intentionally released in Florida, six exotic species were present. Significant differences were observed in species captures among the three most sampled farms, with beetle species dominance patterns differing among the farms. The native species, Onthophagus tuberculifrons Harold, was the most commonly collected species, and both it and the introduced Labarrus pseudolividus Balthasar, had mass emergences. Four of the six most commonly collected species were exotics and included, in order of abundance, L pseudolividus, O. gazella (F.), O. taurus (Schreber), and Euoniticellus intermedius (Reiche).},

	abstract = {We investigated the impacts of habitat disturbance and the resulting changes in biodiversity on ecosystem function in South and Southeast Asian forests using dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) as a focal taxon. Dung beetle sampling and dung burial experiments were conducted in intact, modified, and fragmented forest habitats in three different countries: Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Singapore. Data analysis was split into two themes for analysis: the effect of habitat modification, and the effect of fragmentation. The proportion of dung mass removed was modelled against habitat modification, and the species richness and abundances of the entire dung beetle community, the tunneller communities, and the roller communities. Abundance and richness of tunnellers and the degree of habitat disturbance were the main determinants of dung burial in the habitat modification analysis. Total dung beetle abundance was the main determinant of dung burial in the fragmentation analysis. Through our combined analysis, we show that habitat modification and forest fragmentation impact dung removal activity, albeit through different aspects of the dung beetle community structure.},

A total of 1,611 individuals were sampled, belonging to six tribes, 11 genera and 28 species. The most abundant species were Canthon latipes Blanchard, 1845 (49.9\%), C. chalybaeus Blanchard, 1845 (13.9\%), Deltochilum sculpturatum Felsche, 1907 (4.9\%), and Eurysternus caribaeus (Herbst, 1789) (4.3\%), which accounted for 73\% of the total individuals captured. Traps baited with human excrement captured a higher number of species than those baited with rotten fish. There was no statistically significant difference between the kinds of baits used in relation to the abundance of Scarabaeinae. Most of Scarabaeinae species was represented by generalist feeding habits and tunneler behavior. The community sampled follows the general patterns of trophic and behavioral structure of Scarabaeinae found throughout the Neotropical region.},

Vaz-de-Mello, and Rocco Alfredo Di Mare (2012) Attractiveness of different bait to the Scarabaeinae (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) in forest fragments in extreme southern Brazil. Zoological Studies 51(4): 429-441. The aim of this study was to investigate the attractiveness of different types of bait to the Scarabaeinae. Scarabaeinae fauna was sampled using pitfall traps in 3 forest fragments of Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, between May 2009 and Apr. 2010. Each habitat received 27 traps placed on 3 transects, each containing 3 sets of 3 traps, respectively baited with human excrement, rotten meat, and rotten banana. Of the total number of species and individuals collected, 33 species and 75.02\% of individuals were attracted to human excrement, 29 species and 20.26\% of individuals to meat, and only 25 species and 4.72\% of individuals to the banana. Kruskal-Wallis tests showed significant statistical differences among the mean species richness (H = 20.65, d.f. = 2, p ¡ 0.01) and abundance (H = 21.56, d.f. = 2, p ¡ 0.01) of beetles attracted to each bait type. An ordination analysis showed the formation of different groups according to feeding habits and trophic niche overlap. According to Levins' index, 14 species were coprophagous, 13 were generalists, and 2 necrophagous. Differences found occurred due to the great change in dung beetle assemblages from each type of baited trap during the study period. In this study, human feces was the most attractive bait, differing significantly from carrion and rotten banana in both species richness and abundance of the Scarabaeinae. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/51.4/429.pdf},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0046852},
	abstract = {Spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) use sites composed of one or more trees for sleeping (sleeping sites and sleeping trees, respectively). Beneath these sites/trees they deposit copious amounts of dung in latrines. This behavior results in a clumped deposition pattern of seeds and nutrients that directly impacts the regeneration of tropical forests. Therefore, information on the density and spatial distribution of sleeping sites and latrines, and the characteristics (i.e., composition and structure) of sleeping trees are needed to improve our understanding of the ecological significance of spider monkeys in influencing forest composition. Moreover, since primate populations are increasingly forced to inhabit fragmented landscapes, it is important to assess if these characteristics differ between continuous and fragmented forests. We assessed this novel information from eight independent spider monkey communities in the Lacandona rainforest, Mexico: four continuous forest sites and four forest fragments. Both the density of sleeping sites and latrines did not differ between forest conditions. Latrines were uniformly distributed across sleeping sites, but the spatial distribution of sleeping sites within the areas was highly variable, being particularly clumped in forest fragments. In fact, the average inter-latrine distances were almost double in continuous forest than in fragments. Latrines were located beneath only a few tree species, and these trees were larger in diameter in continuous than fragmented forests. Because latrines may represent hotspots of seedling recruitment, our results have important ecological and conservation implications. The variation in the spatial distribution of sleeping sites across the forest indicates that spider monkeys likely create a complex seed deposition pattern in space and time. However, the use of a very few tree species for sleeping could contribute to the establishment of specific vegetation associations typical of the southeastern Mexican rainforest, such as Terminalia-Dialium, and Brosimum-Dialium.},

	abstract = {Arthropods are the most diverse and abundant group of animals found in tropical lowland forests, and in light of ongoing global change phenomena, it is essential to better understand their responses to anthropogenic disturbances. Here we present a review of arthropod responses to forest deforestation and fragmentation based on studies conducted at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP), located in central Amazonia. These studies involved a wide range of arthropod groups. All but one of the studies evaluated changes in total species number or species density in relation to fragment size, (i.e. area effects), and one-third also evaluated edge effects. Our review indicates that almost every arthropod group studied showed some kind of response to reduction in forest area, including altered abundances, species richness or composition in comparisons of different-sized fragments, fragmented and non-fragmented areas, or comparisons of forest edges and forest interiors. These responses tended to be idiosyncratic, with some groups showing predicted declines in abundance or diversity in the fragments while others show no response or even increases. However, some of the observed effects on arthropods, or on the ecological processes in which they are involved, were transient. The most likely explanation for this was the rapid development of secondary growth around fragments, which greatly increased the connectivity between fragments and the remaining forest. Although the BDFFP has provided many insights regarding the effects of forest fragmentation on arthropod assemblages, many diverse groups, such as canopy arthropods, have received scant attention. For those that have been studied, much remains to be learned regarding the long-term dynamics of these assemblages and how landscape context influences local biodiversity. The BDFFP remains an exceptional site in which to investigate how the ecological interactions in which arthropods are engaged are altered in fragmented landscapes.},

	abstract = {Many studies document high levels of functional redundancy in ecosystems, suggesting that species extinctions will not be detrimental to ecosystem functions and services. However, apparently redundant taxa may prove critical for sustaining ecosystem functions and services in the context of environmental perturbations. Dung beetles (Coleoptera:Scarabaeidae) provide a valuable ecosystem service in temperate agro-ecosystems by increasing rates of dung decomposition and nutrient cycling. However, there is concern that these services may be negatively affected by changes in species richness and composition due to changes in pasture management and negative effects of anthelmintics used to control livestock parasites. We used a mesocosm experiment to investigate the functional importance of dung beetle species richness in a system perturbed by the anthelmintic, ivermectin. We varied dung beetle species richness within three functional groups in factorial combination with ivermectin treatment. In the short term (14 weeks), multi-species dung beetle assemblages achieved higher decomposition rates than monocultures, but only in ivermectin-treated dung. Varying species-specific sensitivities to ivermectin meant that species-rich assemblages sustained ecosystem functioning in the context of this anthropogenic perturbation. Over the longer term (36 weeks), there was a significant, positive effect of species richness on dung decomposition in both ivermectin-treated and untreated dung, underlining the functional importance of maintaining a species-rich dung processing community even in the absence of perturbations to the system. Synthesis and applications. The interacting effects of dung beetle species richness and ivermectin highlight the importance of maintaining diverse assemblages in the face of anthropogenic perturbations and suggest that apparent functional redundancy of species in agro-ecosystems should be interpreted cautiously. Furthermore, different farm management practices (e.g. pesticide use and fragmentation of habitats) may have consequences for ecosystem functions and services that exceed the effects of each when considered in isolation.},

	abstract = {Comparative analyses that link information on species' traits, environmental change, and organism response have rarely identified unambiguous trait correlates of vulnerability. We tested if species' traits could predict local-scale changes in dung beetle population response to three levels of forest conversion intensity within and across two biogeographic regions (the Neotropics and Afro-Eurasian tropics). We combined biodiversity surveys, a global molecular phylogeny, and information on three species' traits hypothesized to influence vulnerability to forest conversion to examine (1) the consistency of beetle population response across regions, (2) if species' traits could predict this response, and (3) the cross-regional consistency of trait-response relationships. Most beetle populations declined following any degree of forest conversion; these declines were strongest for Neotropical species. The relationship between traits and population trend was greatly influenced by local and biogeographic context. We discuss the ability of species' traits to explain population trends and suggest several ways to strengthen trait-response models.},

	abstract = {Dung beetle assemblages (Coleoptera, Scarabaeinae) in Atlantic forest fragments in southern Brazil. The beetles of the subfamily Scarabaeinae are important organisms that participate in the cycle of decomposition, especially in tropical ecosystems. Most species feed on feces (dung) or carcasses (carrion) and are associated with animals that produce their food resources. Dung beetles are divided into three functional groups: rollers, tunnelers and dwellers. This present work aims to study the diversity of dung beetle communities inhabiting fragments of the Atlantic Forest, with the purpose of describing the ecology of the species in southern Brazil. This study was conducted in the region of Campos Novos, in Santa Catarina, where twenty sites of Atlantic forest fragments were sampled. Samplings of dung beetles were conducted using 200 pitfall traps, of which 100 were baited with human feces and another 100 with carrion. Size and environmental complexity were also measured for each forest fragment. A total of 1,502 dung beetles, belonging to six tribes, 12 genera and 33 species, were collected. Results of the Levin's index of niche breadth indicated that 11 species were categorized as being coprophagous, ten as generalists, and two as necrophagous. Most species are tunnelers (19), nine of rollers and four of dwellers. The great diversity of Scarabaeinae in the region of Campos Novos, including several rare species, adds important data to the Scarabaeinae fauna in the central-western region of Santa Catarina. It may also help choosing priority areas for conservation in the region, where human impact, with large areas of monoculture, increasingly threatens the fragments of Mixed Ombrophilous Forest.},

We compared beetle assemblages attracted to pads of cattle dung and rat carcasses in four contrasting vegetation types associated with oak forest. In a total of 52 transects including 3,952 dung pad days and 2,600 carcass-trap days we recorded 14,989 beetles representing 406 species and 33 families. Necrophiles (323 species and 33 families) were considerably more diverse than coprophiles (172 species and 16 families). Staphylinidae were taxonomically and numerically dominant, comprising 45\% of species and 66\% of individuals, respectively. Species estimators (Chao 2) suggested that the observed beetle richness represented 68\% of coprophile and 56\% of necrophile species richness, with rare species constituting the majority of the species: singletons and doubletons = 89 species (52\%) of coprophiles and 166 species (51\%) of necrophiles. Beetle assemblages varied in diversity and composition as regards to vegetation type and season: samples from less disturbed vegetation types (continuous oak forest and ravines) had higher beetle diversity, and a strong seasonality effect was recorded for necrophiles, but not for coprophiles. In addition, an indicator value analysis (IndVal), showed that relatively preserved vegetation types recorded more indicator species as compared to disturbed sites. Our studies clearly demonstrates that the least fragmented oak forest and ravine are the most valuable areas for necrophile and coprophile beetles in Neotropical Mexico, especially for specialist beetles.},

This study provides the first empirical evidence of the impact of urbanization on richness, abundance, composition and guild structure of dung beetle communities from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We evaluated the community aspects (abundance, richness, composition and food guilds) of dung beetles in fragments with different degrees of immersion in the urban matrix using pitfall traps with four alternative baits (rotten meat, rotten fish, pig dung and decaying banana). A total of 1719 individuals were collected, belonging to 29 species from 11 genera and six Scarabaeinae tribes. The most urban-immersed fragment showed a higher species dominance and the beetle community captured on dung presented the greatest evenness. The beetle communities were distinct with respect to the fragments and feeding habits. Except for the dung beetle assemblage in the most urbanized forest fragment, all others exhibited contrasting differences in species composition attracted to each bait type. Our results clearly show that the degree of urbanization affects Atlantic Forest dung beetle communities and that the preservation of forest fragments inside the cities, even small ones, can provide refuges for Scarabaeinae.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is one of the largest contributors of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) responsible for global warming. Measurements of gas fluxes from dung pats suggest that dung is a source of GHGs, but whether these emissions are modified by arthropods has not been studied. A closed chamber system was used to measure the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from dung pats with and without dung beetles on a grass sward. The presence of dung beetles significantly affected the fluxes of GHGs from dung pats. Most importantly, fresh dung pats emitted higher amounts of CO2 and lower amounts of CH4 per day in the presence than absence of beetles. Emissions of N2O showed a distinct peak three weeks after the start of the experiment - a pattern detected only in the presence of beetles. When summed over the main grazing season (June-July), total emissions of CH4 proved significantly lower, and total emissions of N2O significantly higher in the presence than absence of beetles. While clearly conditional on the experimental conditions, the patterns observed here reveal a potential impact of dung beetles on gas fluxes realized at a small spatial scale, and thereby suggest that arthropods may have an overall effect on gas fluxes from agriculture. Dissecting the exact mechanisms behind these effects, mapping out the range of conditions under which they occur, and quantifying effect sizes under variable environmental conditions emerge as key priorities for further research.},

	abstract = {1. Circellium bacchus is South Africa's largest ball-rolling dung beetle and a habitat specialist of dense bush. It is also wingless, a rare phenomenon amongst large dung beetles and, unusual for the group, only females construct and bury brood balls. She cares for the single brood for 4-5 months, and lives for 3-5 years. 2. The beetles currently occur in two separate populations in South Africa, one in the south-east and one consisting of at least eight fragmented sub-populations in the south-west. Here, we use both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences to infer the evolutionary history of this species. 3. The Eastern and Western populations are genetically separated by 14\% mitochondrial sequence divergence, sharing only a single nuclear haplotype. Mitochondrial and nuclear data indicate that C. bacchus belongs to an ancient (Eocene) relict lineage and that the Eastern and Western populations appear to have been separated by Pliocene continental uplift and a relictual Pleistocene block of temperate forest. Subsequent Plio-Pleistocene climatic change caused further fragmentation of the Western population, now exacerbated by human-induced land transformation. 4. The Eastern and Western populations are identifiable as two distinctly separate entities of possible species status, but with definite need for recognition as evolutionary significant units. The Western sub-populations are genetically significantly different enough to be defined and recognised as management units. The Eastern population is largely distributed in the Addo Elephant National Park where its persistence is currently secure, but the sub-populations of the Western lineage occur as fragments of various sizes in a matrix of agriculturally transformed landscape.},

	abstract = {In landscapes where tropical dry forest was once the dominant vegetation type, traditional silvopastoral systems generate a range of natural and semi-natural habitats, namely fragments of secondary forest and fallow land in various stages of succession; essentially Acacia woodlots. This level of heterogeneity seems to favor the arrival and persistence of a large number of Scarabaeinae species. Changes in dung and carrion beetle assemblages were assessed in a silvopastoral landscape in Chiapas, Mexico by intensive sampling using baited pitfall traps. Total species richness decreased from late successional habitats to early successional habitats and average abundance per site was higher in the intermediate successional stages. The silvopastoral system studied is very dynamic; its components may remain constant or change over time, depending on management. These changing conditions lead to a variable local species richness and allow the permeability of certain species within the landscape. There was high species turnover among successional habitats, generating a gamma diversity similar to that of tropical dry forest landscapes and 2-fold higher than the highest recorded alpha diversity value. Silvopastoral systems can buffer the adverse effects of rapid expansion of open areas and the consequent reduction of tropical dry forest area generated by technified conventional systems.},

	abstract = {What is the importance of open habitat in a predominantly closed forest to the dung beetle assemblage? The Atlantic Forest in Brazil is one of the most highly disturbed ecosystems and is mainly represented by fragmented areas. However, in places where human disturbances have ceased, certain areas are showing a natural regeneration pattern. The aim of the present study was to determine how the dung beetle assemblage responds to distinct habitat structures in a fragment of Atlantic Forest. For such, open and closed forest areas were sampled in a fragment of the Atlantic Forest in the northeastern region of Brazil. Pitfall traps baited with excrement and carrion were used to collect the beetles. A total of 7,267 individuals belonging to 35 species were captured. Canthon chalybaeus and C. mutabilis were restricted to open areas. Nearly 90\% of the individuals of C. aff. simulans and Deltochilum aff. irroratum were identified in these areas. A higher percentage (¿ 50\%) of Canthon staigi, Dichotomius aff. depressicolis and D. aff. sericeus occurred in closed areas. Abundance differed between areas, with higher values in closed areas. Richness was not influenced by the habitat structure. NMDS ordination exhibited the segregation of areas and ANOSIM confirmed that this variable explained the assemblage of dung beetle species. The findings of the present study validate that open areas are associated to more restrictive conditions, limiting a higher abundance of dung beetle. Although situated near preserved fragments, the studied open areas increase the heterogeneity of the general landscape.},

	abstract = {Edge effect is a key process influencing populations and communities, particularly in fragmented landscapes. A general analytical framework has been proposed to quantify the strength of the edge effects (extent and magnitude); however, factors determining the later remain poorly explored. Using a continuous approach we explore the response of dung beetle species and assemblages to ecotones which differ in environmental dissimilarity in the Southern Atlantic forest of Argentina. Using baited pitfall traps and automatic sensors, we estimated dung beetle abundance, microclimatic conditions and vegetation structure along five different forest-plantations transects. At the assemblages level, the majority of species showed either edge avoidance or preference; however, the response depended on the environmental dissimilarity between habitats (plantation and native forest) and varied from a neutral response on mature plantations (low contrast ecotone) to edge avoidance on recent ones (high contrast ecotone). At the species level, the degree of habitat specialization explains the differential response of species to edge effects; more specialized species showed stronger edge response while generalist species showed softer or neutral responses. Environmental dissimilarity between confronted habitats and species specialization explain the quantitative component of edge effects on species and assemblages. Functional groups (rollers and tunnellers) often showed opposite responses to edge effects. At the landscape level, functional connectivity of forest fragments is probably drastically reduced by high contrasts matrices (such as recent plantations) for native forest species, whereas soft ecotones (such as native forest-mature plantations) maintained functional connectivity. These results are particularly relevant on highly fragmented landscapes, such as the Atlantic forest, where edge effect is probably one the most important mechanisms affecting native species and communities.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.09.036},
	abstract = {Riparian forests provide important habitat for many wildlife species and are sensitive to landscape change. Among terrestrial invertebrates, dung beetles have been used to investigate the effects of environmental disturbances on forest structure and diversity. Since many studies demonstrated a negative response of dung beetle communities to increasing forest fragmentation, and that most dung beetle species had a more pronounced occurrence during warmest seasons, three hypotheses were tested: (1) Scarabaeinae richness, abundance, diversity and evenness are lower in thinner riparian zone widths than in wider widths during the warmest seasons; (2) Scarabaeinae richness and abundance are positively influenced by leaf litter coverage and height and canopy cover; and (3) Scarabaeinae composition varies with the reduction in riparian vegetation and among annual seasons. We selected four fragments with different riparian zone widths in three secondary streams in southern Brazil. In each fragment, four sampling periods were carried out seasonally between spring 2010 and winter 2011. We collected dung beetles using pitfall traps with two types of bait. We collected 1289 specimens distributed among 29 species. In spring and summer, dung beetle richness was higher in fragments with the widest riparian zone than in those with a thinner riparian zone, and it did not vary between fragments in fall and winter seasons. Dung beetle abundance did not differ among fragments with different riparian zone widths, but it was higher in spring and summer than fall and winter. Richness and abundance were positively influenced by leaf litter. While dung beetle diversity was higher in fragments with wider riparian zone widths than in those with thinner widths, the evenness was similar among fragments. Dung beetle composition differed between the fragments with the widest and thinnest riparian zones, and it also varied among the seasons. Our results suggest that decreased riparian zones affect negatively to dung beetle community structure in southern Brazil. Fragments with thinner riparian zones had lower beetle richness in warmest seasons and an altered community composition. In this sense, the dung beetles are potentially good indicators of riparian forest fragmentation since some species were indicators of a particular riparian zone width. From a conservation perspective, our results demonstrate that the new Brazilian Forest Code will greatly jeopardize not only the terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity of these ecosystems, but also countless other ecological functions.

	abstract = {Selective logging is a major driver of rainforest degradation across the tropics. Two competing logging strategies are proposed to meet timber demands with the least impact on biodiversity: land sharing, which combines timber extraction with biodiversity protection across the concession; and land sparing, in which higher intensity logging is combined with the protection of intact primary forest reserves. We evaluate these strategies by comparing the abundances and species richness of birds, dung beetles and ants in Borneo, using a protocol that allows us to control for both timber yield and net profit across strategies. Within each taxonomic group, more species had higher abundances with land-sparing than land-sharing logging, and this translated into significantly higher species richness within land-sparing concessions. Our results are similar when focusing only on species found in primary forest and restricted in range to Sundaland, and they are independent of the scale of sampling. For each taxonomic group, land-sparing logging was the most promising strategy for maximizing the biological value of logging operations.},

	doi = {10.1093/jisesa/ieu161},
	abstract = {Mammal feces are the primary food and nesting resource for the majority of dung beetle species, and larval development depends on the quantity and quality of that resource. Physiological necessities, competitive interactions, and resource sharing are common and suggest that dung beetles may show preferences for feces of greater nutritional quality, which may in turn impact beetle assemblages and community structure. This study investigated whether attractiveness of dung beetles to different resource ( feces) types varies depending on mammal trophic guild and associated nutritional content. This study was conducted in Atlantic Forest fragments in the Parque Estadual da Serra do Tabuleiro, Santa Catarina, Brazil. To evaluate attractiveness, the feces of the carnivore Puma concolor, the omnivores Cerdocyon thous and Sapajus nigritus, and the herbivore Tapirus terrestris were utilized as bait. Dung was collected from zoo animals fed a standard diet. Sampling was performed in triplicate in five areas in the summer of 2013. Four pitfall traps were established in each area, and each trap was baited with one type of mammal feces. Food preference of the species was analyzed by calculating Rodgers' index for cafeteria-type experiments. In total, 426 individuals from 17 species were collected. Rodgers' index showed that omnivorous mammal feces (C. thous) were most attractive to all dung beetle species, although it is known that dung beetles are commonly opportunistic with respect to search for and allocation of food resources. These results suggest that mammal loss could alter competitive interactions between dung beetles.},

We used baited-traps to collect dung beetles in habitats with two different sika deer densities near Lake Toya, Hokkaido, Japan; Nakajima Island (high-density) and the nearby lakeshore forest (low-density). Overall, our results showed that dung beetle abundance was associated with higher deer density. Although differences in dung beetle species richness, diversity index and beta diversity were not statistically significant among deer densities. NMDS analysis showed that dung beetle community composition did vary with deer density. Our results indicate that, where deer density is high, the dung beetle community characterized by grassland species, including Caccobius jessoensis, Aphodius pusillus and A. rectus. Conversely, where deer density is low, the dung beetle community comprises forest species such as Phelotrupes laevistriatus. Our study suggests that deer density strongly influences dung beetle species abundance via the volume of deer dung. Additionally, we show that forest dwelling dung beetle species give way to grassland dwelling species at higher deer densities.},

	abstract = {In this study, we compared ground-dwelling beetle assemblages (Coleoptera) from a range of different oak fragments and surrounding conifer plantations to evaluate effects of forest size and surrounding matrix habitat in a temperate forest of north China. During 2000, beetles were sampled via pitfall traps within two large oak fragments (ca. 2.0-4.0 ha), two small oak fragments (ca. 0.2-0.4 ha) and two surrounding matrices dominated by pine plantations (¿4 ha) in two sites of different aspects. Overall, no significantly negative effects from forest patch size and the surrounding matrix habitat were detected in total species number and abundance of ground-dwelling beetles. However, compared with small oak patches or pine plantations, more species were associated with an affinity for at least one large oak patch of the two aspects. Multivariate regression trees showed that the habitat type better determined the beetle assemblage structure than patch size and aspect, indicating a strong impact of the surrounding matrix. Linear mixed models indicated that species richness and abundance of all ground-dwelling beetles or beetle families showed different responses to the selected environmental variables. Our results suggest that more disturbed sites are significantly poorer in oak forest specialists, which are usually more abundant in large oak fragments and decrease in abundance or disappear in small fragments and surrounding matrix habitats. Thus, it is necessary to preserve a minimum size of forest patch to create conditions characteristic for forest interior, rather than the more difficult task of increasing habitat connectivity.},

	abstract = {We studied the diversity of dung beetle communities in Japanese pastures to identify the factors that maintain or enhance the diversity of dung beetles at a landscape scale. We surveyed dung beetles from 17 pastures located in the northeastern part of Tochigi Prefecture, which is in the center of mainland Japan. From 1999 to 2001, surveys were conducted during the 6-month grazing period (May to October) by using dung baited basket traps. We also collected information about the environmental conditions and pasture management practices. Twenty-five dung beetle species belonging to Geotrupinae, Scarabaeinae, and Aphodiinae (including 13 tunneler and 12 dweller species) were recorded. The abundance of dweller species decreased with increasing elevation, possibly because of the effect of rainfall, whereas the species richness of tunneler species was affected by cattle disturbance and soil condition. Beetle species richness significantly increased with the number of years that the pastures had been grazed. Ivermectin administration did not appear to have any adverse effect on dung beetle abundance, species richness, or species diversity. The dung beetle datasets of the current study (including specific tunneler and dweller beetle groups) supported the widely documented positive relationship between local abundance and species distribution ranges. The within pasture, within area, and between area hierarchical additive partitioning of regional total diversity indicated that landscape-scale management should be implemented to conserve the regional diversity of the dung beetle communities inhabiting Japanese pastures.},

	doi = {10.1002/ece3.1003},
	abstract = {Agricultural expansion and intensification are major threats to global biodiversity, ecological functions, and ecosystem services. The rapid expansion of oil palm in forested tropical landscapes is of particular concern given their high biodiversity. Identifying management approaches that maintain native species and associated ecological processes within oil palm plantations is therefore a priority. Riparian reserves are strips of forest retained alongside rivers in cultivated areas, primarily for their positive hydrological impact. However, they can also support a range of forest-dependent species or ecosystem services. We surveyed communities of dung beetles and measured dung removal activity in an oil palm-dominated landscape in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. The species richness, diversity, and functional group richness of dung beetles in riparian reserves were significantly higher than in oil palm, but lower than in adjacent logged forests. The community composition of the riparian reserves was more similar to logged forest than oil palm. Despite the pronounced differences in biodiversity, we did not find significant differences in dung removal rates among land uses. We also found no evidence that riparian reserves enhance dung removal rates within surrounding oil palm. These results contrast previous studies showing positive relationships between dung beetle species richness and dung removal in tropical forests. We found weak but significant positive relationships between riparian reserve width and dung beetle diversity, and between reserve vegetation complexity and dung beetle abundance, suggesting that these features may increase the conservation value of riparian reserves. Synthesis and applications: The similarity between riparian reserves and logged forest demonstrates that retaining riparian reserves increases biodiversity within oil palm landscapes. However, the lack of correlation between dung beetle community characteristics and dung removal highlights the need for further research into spatial variation in biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships and how the results of such studies are affected by methodological choices.},

	abstract = {With the rapidly expanding ecological footprint of agriculture, the design of farmed landscapes will play an increasingly important role for both carbon storage and biodiversity protection. Carbon and biodiversity can be enhanced by integrating natural habitats into agricultural lands, but a key question is whether benefits are maximized by including many small features throughout the landscape ('land-sharing' agriculture) or a few large contiguous blocks alongside intensive farmland ('land-sparing' agriculture). In this study, we are the first to integrate carbon storage alongside multi-taxa biodiversity assessments to compare land-sparing and land-sharing frameworks. We do so by sampling carbon stocks and biodiversity (birds and dung beetles) in landscapes containing agriculture and forest within the Colombian Choco-Andes, a zone of high global conservation priority. We show that woodland fragments embedded within a matrix of cattle pasture hold less carbon per unit area than contiguous primary or advanced secondary forests (¿15 years). Farmland sites also support less diverse bird and dung beetle communities than contiguous forests, even when farmland retains high levels of woodland habitat cover. Landscape simulations based on these data suggest that land-sparing strategies would be more beneficial for both carbon storage and biodiversity than land-sharing strategies across a range of production levels. Biodiversity benefits of land-sparing are predicted to be similar whether spared lands protect primary or advanced secondary forests, owing to the close similarity of bird and dung beetle communities between the two forest classes. Land-sparing schemes that encourage the protection and regeneration of natural forest blocks thus provide a synergy between carbon and biodiversity conservation, and represent a promising strategy for reducing the negative impacts of agriculture on tropical ecosystems. However, further studies examining a wider range of ecosystem services will be necessary to fully understand the links between land-allocation strategies and long-term ecosystem service provision.},

These insects are sensitive to habitat modification mainly related to vegetation cover. The substitution of the Amazon forest by pasture cause drastic changes in the habitat of native species. This reduces richness and modifies assembly species composition. The aim of this work was understand the effects of substitution of native forest by pasture introduced in richness, abundance, species composition and structure of feeding guilds of dung beetle in southwestern Brazilian Amazon. A total of 10,073 individuals of dung beetles were collected, belonging to 84 species in 22 genera. Forests areas (six secondary forest fragments) had 71 species and the pastures areas (neighboring areas where original forest was substitution by introduced pasture) had significantly lower richness (30 species), and community turnover between forests and pasture was very high. In forests the majority of species were generalist, while pastures showed higher abundance of coprophagous species, which shows a change in feeding guilds caused by the substitution of forest by pasture. Among 30 species collected in pastures, twelve are present in native open vegetation too (cerrado e chaco). That represents a recent regional colonization, where species of dung beetles, coming from open areas, are invading the Amazonian pastures.},

	doi = {10.1093/jis/14.1.123},
	abstract = {Dung beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea: Scarabaeinae) activity is influenced by rainfall seasonality. We hypothesized that rainfall might also play a major role in regulating the community structure of this group. In this study, we describe seasonal changes in the richness, composition, and structure of the Scarabaeinae community in a Brazilian tropical dry forest. A fragment of arboreal Caatinga was sampled using baited pitfall traps during the early dry season (EDS), late dry season (LDS), early wet season (EWS), and middle wet season (MWS). We compared the dung beetle community in each season in relationship to species richness, rank-dominance, curves, and composition. We collected 1352 Scarabaeinae individuals, belonging to 15 species. Dichotomius aff. laevicollis Felsche (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) was the dominant species, representing 73.89\% of the individuals. There were no seasonal changes in the rank dominance curves; all had a single dominant species and a few species with low abundance, typical for arid areas. Estimated richness was highest in MWS, followed by EWS. Dry-season samples (EDS and LDS) had lower richness, with no significant difference between the dry seasons. Although species richness increased as the habitat became wetter, the difference between the wet and dry seasons was small, which differs completely from the findings of other studies in Neotropical dry forests, where almost all species cease activities in the dry season. Species composition changes were found in non-metric multidimensional scaling and sustained by analysis of similarity. All the seasons had pairwise differences in composition, with the exception of EDS and MWS, which indicates that the dung beetle community in this fragment requires more than three months of drought to trigger changes in species composition; this is probably due to small changes in the forest canopy. There was no difference in composition between EDS and MWS. As in other tropical dry forests, although to a lesser extent, the dung beetle community of this fragment responded to rainfall seasonality with changes in species composition and reduced species richness. Such responses, even to this lesser extent, may occur because of small changes in tree cover and minor microclimate changes.},

In total, 1,581 individuals belonging to 16 morphospecies were sampled, with six new records for Caatinga. The dung beetles were mainly from generalist and coprophagous species; seven species presented nocturnal activity, and five were diurnal. There was higher species richness during the day and greater abundance during the night. Species composition differences were influenced by functional guilds and beetle size according to temporal segregation. These factors may be related to physiological, morphological, and behavioral differences.},

	volume = {46},
	issn = {0006-3606},
	doi = {10.1111/btp.12158},
	abstract = {Conservation of biodiversity in production forests is crucial for mitigating biodiversity loss in the tropics. The major ecological impacts of selective logging are often the result of small clearings for skid trails, logging roads, log yards, and logging camps; however, their impacts on forest biodiversity have rarely been examined. The purpose of this study was to assess the impacts of these clearings on a forest-dependent faunal group, dung beetles, and to identify the environmental factors responsible. Abundance and species richness of dung beetles decreased drastically in clearings, but directly increased in forests with the distance from roads/trails; abundance and species richness at 10m from roads/trails were almost comparable with those detected in further interior forests. Similarly, species composition was significantly different between forests and clearings (except skid trails) but recovered within a short distance from roads/trails. Canopy openness was the most important environmental factor affecting the abundance, and species richness and composition of dung beetles; most dung beetle species were concentrated under closed forest canopy with less than 10 percent of canopy openness, whereas canopy openness ranged from 16 to 53 percent in clearings. Our study demonstrates that even small-scale, unpaved clearings affect dung beetle communities through increased canopy openness. Although the effective distance was not very large, a considerable portion of logged areas can be affected when road networks are dense therefore minimizing the density of road networks and enhancing canopy recovery after logging are important for retaining biodiversity in tropical production forests. Abstrak Pemeliharaan biodiversiti dalam hutan pengusahasilan amat penting dalam mitigasi kehilangan biodiversiti di kawasan tropika. Impak utama daripada aktiviti pembalakkan biasanya berpunca daripada pembersihan kawasan berskala kecil untuk pembinaan jalan penarik, jalan tuju, matau dan kongsi (penempatan sementara). Namun, impak pembersihan kawasan ini ke atas biodiversiti jarang dikaji.Tujuan utama kajian ini ialah untuk menilai impak kawasan yang dibersihkan ini ke atas kumbang tinja, iaitu kumpulan fauna yang bergantung kepada habitat hutan, serta mengenalpasti faktor-faktor persekitaran yang menyebabkan perubahan ini. Kelimpahan dan kekayaan spesis kumbang tinja didapati berkurangan dengan ketara di kawasan yang dibersihkan tetapi meningkat dengan peningkatan jarak daripada jalan/denai di dalam kawasan hutan. Kelimpahan dan kepelbagain spesis kumbang tinja 10m daripada jalan/denai adalah serupa dengan kelimpahan dan kepelbagaian spesis yang berada jauh di dalam kawasan hutan. Komposisi spesis di antara kawasan hutan dan kawasan yang telah dibersihkan (kecuali jalan tarik) adalah berbeza tetapi mulai menjadi serupa tidak jauh daripada jalan/denai. Pembukaan silara merupakan faktor persekitaran paling penting yang mempengaruhi kelimpahan, kepelbagaian dan komposisi spesis kumbang tinja di mana kebanyakkan spesis kumbang tinja tertumpu di kawasan dengan pembukaan silara kurang daripada 10 peratus. Kawasan yang telah dibersihkan merekodkan pembukaan silara sebanyak 16 hingga 53 peratus. Kajian ini menunjukkan aktiviti pembersihan kawasan walaupun pada skala kecil akan meningkatkan pembukaan silara lalu memberi impak kepada komuniti kumbang tinja. Walaupun jarak impak daripada kawasan yang dibersihkan adalah kecil, namun ia akan melibatkan kawasan yang luas sekiranya jaringan jalan di sesuatu hutan pengusahasilan adalah padat. Maka pembinaan jalan perlu diminimumkan dan pemuliharaan pembukaan silara adalah mustahak bagi tujuan pemeliharaan bidoversiti di hutan pengusahasilan.},

	volume = {9},
	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0114015},
	abstract = {Responses to microhabitat are often neglected when ecologists sample animal indicator groups. Microhabitats may be particularly influential in non-passive biodiversity sampling methods, such as baited traps or light traps, and for certain taxonomic groups which respond to fine scale environmental variation, such as insects. Here we test the effects of microhabitat on measures of species diversity, guild structure and biomass of dung beetles, a widely used ecological indicator taxon. We demonstrate that choice of trap placement influences dung beetle functional guild structure and species diversity. We found that locally measured environmental variables were unable to fully explain trap-based differences in species diversity metrics or microhabitat specialism of functional guilds. To compare the effects of habitat degradation on biodiversity across multiple sites, sampling protocols must be standardized and scale-relevant. Our work highlights the importance of considering microhabitat scale responses of indicator taxa and designing robust sampling protocols which account for variation in microhabitats during trap placement. We suggest that this can be achieved either through standardization of microhabitat or through better efforts to record relevant environmental variables that can be incorporated into analyses to account for microhabitat effects. This is especially important when rapidly assessing the consequences of human activity on biodiversity loss and associated ecosystem function and services.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity continues to decline in the face of increasing anthropogenic pressures such as habitat destruction, exploitation, pollution and introduction of alien species. Existing global databases of species' threat status or population time series are dominated by charismatic species. The collation of datasets with broad taxonomic and biogeographic extents, and that support computation of a range of biodiversity indicators, is necessary to enable better understanding of historical declines and to project - and avert - future declines. We describe and assess a new database of more than 1.6 million samples from 78 countries representing over 28,000 species, collated from existing spatial comparisons of local-scale biodiversity exposed to different intensities and types of anthropogenic pressures, from terrestrial sites around the world. The database contains measurements taken in 208 (of 814) ecoregions, 13 (of 14) biomes, 25 (of 35) biodiversity hotspots and 16 (of 17) megadiverse countries. The database contains more than 1\% of the total number of all species described, and more than 1\% of the described species within many taxonomic groups - including flowering plants, gymnosperms, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, beetles, lepidopterans and hymenopterans. The dataset, which is still being added to, is therefore already considerably larger and more representative than those used by previous quantitative models of biodiversity trends and responses. The database is being assembled as part of the PREDICTS project (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems - ). We make site-level summary data available alongside this article. The full database will be publicly available in 2015.},

	abstract = {Community structure is driven by mechanisms linked to environmental, spatial and temporal processes, which have been successfully addressed using metacommunity framework. The relative importance of processes shaping community structure can be identified using several different approaches. Two approaches that are increasingly being used are functional diversity and community deconstruction. Functional diversity is measured using various indices that incorporate distinct community attributes. Community deconstruction is a way to disentangle species responses to ecological processes by grouping species with similar traits. We used these two approaches to determine whether they are improvements over traditional measures (e.g., species composition, abundance, biomass) for identification of the main processes driving dung beetle (Scarabaeinae) community structure in a fragmented mainland-island landscape in southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We sampled five sites in each of four large forest areas, two on the mainland and two on the island. Sampling was performed in 2012 and 2013. We collected abundance and biomass data from 100 sampling points distributed over 20 sampling sites. We studied environmental, spatial and temporal effects on dung beetle community across three spatial scales, i.e., between sites, between areas and mainland-island. The.-diversity based on species abundance was mainly attributed to beta-diversity as a consequence of the increase in mean alpha- and beta-diversity between areas. Variation partitioning on abundance, biomass and functional diversity showed scale-dependence of processes structuring dung beetle metacommunities. We identified two major groups of responses among 17 functional groups. In general, environmental filters were important at both local and regional scales. Spatial factors were important at the intermediate scale. Our study supports the notion of scale-dependence of environmental, spatial and temporal processes in the distribution and functional organization of Scarabaeinae beetles. We conclude that functional diversity may be used as a complementary approach to traditional measures, and that community deconstruction allows sufficient disentangling of responses of different trait-based groups.},

	abstract = {Identifying and making use of ecological indicators becomes an essential task in the conservation of tropical systems, mainly in fragmented landscapes where land use intensification and habitat loss are confounding factors in the detection of species' responses to human-caused disturbance. We aimed to analyze the importance of anthropogenic land use and fragmentation-related effects on dung beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) persistence according to the interior-exterior non-linear gradient (forest + matrix) in a fragmented Atlantic Forest landscape used to sugar cane production and cattle ranching/farming. We offer scores for a comprehensive set of community-level attributes, from beetle abundance to taxonomic and ecological composition (i.e. species body size), including a list of indicator species of different forest habitats and adjacent matrix. Dung beetles were surveyed by traps across forest interiors (i.e. core forest areas) and edges of a primary forest, small fragments, sugar cane fields and pastures in a total of 60 sites. Indicator analyses were conducted across the landscape, using two well-established methods (IndVal and SIMPER). Our results suggest that (1) cross-habitat taxonomic distinctness is associated with the presence of indicator species, (2) some species benefit or are dependent of open habitats created by human-disturbances, such as forest edges (e.g. Canthon nigripennis) and matrices (e.g. Canthon aff. piluliformis, Dichotomius nisus and Trichilum externepunctatum), (3) although landscape habitats exhibit reduced beta diversity, dung beetle assemblages are spatially organized in response to the presence of both forest habitats and matrix and fragment area, (4) forest interior supports beetle assemblages biased toward large-bodied species, (5) accordingly forest interior, forest edges and matrix support taxonomically distinct assemblages, both contributing to the bulk of species richness at landscape level, (6) the response of dung beetles to the interior-exterior non-linear gradient (i.e. forest edge+matrix) reveals a similar pattern regardless of the nature of the matrix, and (7) there is no within-habitat variation in beetle abundance and species richness associated with distance from forest edge. Given that there is a high number of forest-dependent or forest-interior specialist species (e.g. Aphengium aff. sordidum, Ateuchus aff. alipioi, Dichotomius mormon, Ontherus aff. erosus and Onthophagus aff. clypeatus) dung beetle persistence in human-modified landscape is highly dependent on the presence of core areas, although edge-affected and matrix habitats may be complementary. This information is essential to permit a better prospect for dung beetle persistence in human-modified landscapes as they continue to move toward edge-dominated landscapes with intensively managed matrices.

	abstract = {Effects of coprophagous insects on greenhouse gas emissions from cattle dung pats were investigated during the initial stage in the decomposition of dung, with accompanying changes in nitrogen, carbon, and energy content. We set up three treatments with adults of Caccobius jessoensis Harold (dung beetle) and larvae of the fly Neomyia cornicina (F.): 1) dung with dung beetles; 2) dung with fly larvae; and 3) dung without insects. In these treatments, the gas flux was measured from air flow exiting the glass containers connected with an in vitro continuous gas analysis system. Total gas fluxes from dung pats with fly larvae were lowest in carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). The presence of dung beetles significantly increased CO2 flux from dung, but reduced CH4 flux compared with dung without insects. Fluxes of N2O from dung pats with dung beetles and without insects had distinct peaks at different times after the start of the experiment, while N2O from dung with fly larvae was emitted in extremely low levels throughout the experiment. Carbon (C) content in dung with beetles was significantly lower than that of untreated dung pats designated as fresh dung, whereas that of dung with fly larvae was higher than dung with beetles and without insects. Nitrogen (N) content was significantly lower in dung with fly larvae than the other treatments. Contents of C and N in fly pupae were 35.87 and 8.05\%, respectively. During the larval growth of the fly, energy accumulated in the fly body was 2,830 J/g.},

	abstract = {The aims of this study were to characterize the fauna of dung beetles and analyze their spatial and temporal diversity in a cattle ranch in the province of Chaco. Seven surveys were conducted in three environmental units: a forest fragment, a cattle pasture, and an open grassland. The efficiency of the sampling was assessed with non-parametric richness estimators, and attributes of the assemblage were evaluated. The species composition and the abundance distribution in each of the environmental units studied were compared using rank-abundance curves. The indicator value of each species was measured with the IndVal method. The relationship between richness, abundance, and environmental variables (temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity) was calculated by multivariate multiple regression analysis. A total of 3,356 adult individuals belonging to 29 species of the subfamily Scarabaeinae and to five species of Aphodiinae were captured. Dichotomius nisus (Olivier), Trichillum externepunctatum (Preudhomme), Canthon podagricus (Harold), Onthophagus hirculus (Mannerheim), Pseudocanthon aff. perplexus, Ontherus sulcator (Fabricius), and Ataenius platensis (Blanchard) were the most abundant. Diversity, species richness, and abundance were highest in the forest fragment and in spring and summer captures. Between 94\% and 97\% of the species present in the entire landscape were recorded. According to the analysis of similarity, the composition of the assemblage was different among habitats. Eurysternus caribaeus (Herbst), Eurysternus aeneus (G,nier), and O. sulcator were indicators of the forest. In the three units, the coprophagous species represented more than 60\% of the total species number. The rainfall regime, the temperature, and the heterogeneous use of the environmental units influenced the structure of dung beetle assemblages.},

	abstract = {We investigated the composition and structure of dung beetle communities (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae, Scarabaeinae) inhabiting areas of forest fragments next to either conventional or Bt-transgenic maize crops. The purpose of the study was to examine possible impacts of transgenic plants on non-target organisms associated with mammals through their food chain. In February 2011, we collected a total of 1502 beetles belonging to 33 species in Campos Novos, Santa Catarina state (SC), Brazil. Beetles were captured using 200 pitfall traps distributed among 20 forest fragments, 10 fragments in each site type (adjacent to conventional vs. Bt crops). In the fragments adjacent to conventional maize, 805 dung beetles from 27 species were collected. In the fragments adjacent to Bt-transgenic maize, 697 dung beetles from 27 species were caught. Dung beetle community composition was affected by fragment size and environmental complexity, and by distance between fragments. However, it did not explain the differences related to the two crop types, i.e., the functional group of dwellers was significantly over-represented in the fragments surrounded by transgenic maize. Hence, the dweller species Eurysternus francinae and Eurysternus parallelus were more frequent and abundant in fragments located near the transgenic maize, while the tunneler species Onthophagus tristis, Uroxys terminalis, Ontherus sulcator and the roller species Canthon lividus seminitens were more frequent and abundant in fragments surrounded by conventional maize. This observed impact of transgenic crops on functional group dynamics within dung beetle communities could potentially lead to impaired capacity for feces removal, seed dispersal, edaphic aeration, and incorporation of organic matter in the soil in these areas, as such ecosystem services are not performed by the dominant functional group (i.e., dwellers).

	abstract = {Human activities in tropical forests are the main causes of forest fragmentation. According to historical factor in deforestation processes, forest remnants exhibit different sizes and shapes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the dung beetle assemblage on fragments of different degree of sizes. Sampling was performed during rainy and dry season of 2010 in six fragments of Atlantic forest, using pitfall traps baited with excrement and carrion. Also, we used two larger fragments as control. We used General Linear Models to determine whether the fragments presented distinguished dung beetle abundance and richness. Analysis of Similarities and Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling were used to determine whether the dung beetle assemblage was grouped according to species composition. A total of 3352 individuals were collected and 19 species were identified in the six fragments sampled. Dung beetle abundance exhibited a shift according to fragment size; however, richness did not change among fragments evaluated. Also, fragments sampled and the two controls exhibited distinct species composition. The distinction on abundance of dung beetles among fragments may be related to different amount of resource available in each one. It is likely that the dung beetle richness did not distinguish among the different fragments due to the even distribution of the mammal communities in these patches, and consequent equal dung diversity. We conclude that larger fragments encompass higher abundance of dung beetle and distinct species. However, for a clearer understanding of effects of fragmentation on dung beetles in Atlantic forest, studies evaluating narrower variations of larger fragments should be conducted.

	abstract = {Rapid deforestation has fragmented habitat across the landscape of Madagascar. To determine the effect of fragmentation on seed banks and the potential for forest regeneration, we sampled seed viability, density and diversity in 40 plots of 1m(2) in three habitat types: forest fragments, the near edge of continuous forest, and deforested savanna in a highly fragmented dry deciduous forest landscape in northwestern Madagascar. While seed species diversity was not different between forest fragments and continuous forest edge, the number of animal-dispersed seeds was significantly higher in forest fragments than in continuous forest edge, and this pattern was driven by a single, small-seeded species. In the savanna, seeds were absent from all but three of the 40 plots, indicating that regeneration potential is low in these areas. Several pre- and post-dispersal biotic and abiotic factors, including variation in the seed predator communities and edge effects could explain these findings. Understanding the extent to which seed dispersal and seed banks influence the regeneration potential of fragmented landscapes is critical as these fragments are the potential sources of forest expansion and re-connectivity. Resume Le sort de graines dispersees peut etre altere en reponse a la perte et la fragmentation d' habitats, modifiant ainsi les banques de semences du sol. Nous avons echantillonne la viabilite, la densite et la diversite des graines dans 40 parcelles de 1m(2) en trois types d'habitats dans le paysage forestier feuillu, sec, et fragmente du nord-ouest de Madagascar: (1) fragments de foret (2) bords rapproches de foret ininterrompue, et (3) savane deboisee. Notre objectif etait d'etablir l'effet de cette fragmentation sur les banques de semences, et la possibilite de regeneration forestier. Nos resultats demontrent, bien que la diversite des especes de semences ne varie pas entre les fragments de foret et les bords rapproches de foret ininterrompue, que la quantite de graines dispersees par les animaux est considerablement plus elevee dans le premier type d'habitat que dans la deuxieme, et que cet effet est grace a une seule espece [a petites graines]. Dans la savane deboisee, une absence complete de graines a ete notee dans tous les 40 parcelles, a part trois. Plusieurs facteurs biotiques ainsi qu' abiotiques, pre- et post-dispersion, sont impliques, y compris des variations au sein des communautes de predateurs de graines ainsi que des effets de lisiere. Le potentiel de regeneration en paysages fragmentes repose sur une meilleure comprehension de la nature et l'etendue des changements dans la dispersion des graines, ainsi que les resultantes banques de semences. Ceci est particulierement important au Madagascar, oU la perte des forets se poursuit a un rythme precipite, puisque ces fragments sont les sources essentielles de l'expansion et de la reconnexion forestiere.},

	abstract = {1. Experimental studies linking community composition to functioning are typically confined to small and closed micro- or mesocosms. Such restricted conditions may affect both species' biology and their environment. Yet, targeting simple features in the behaviour of species may circumvent these constraints. Focusing on ecological functions provided by dung beetles, we test whether large, open-top cages - MESOCLOSURES - will intercept the flight trajectories of beetles, thereby allowing manipulation of local community composition. 2. MESOCLOSURES were built in both tropical forest (Brazil) and temperate grasslands (Finland), thus testing their general efficiency. Within the respective environments, we varied different aspects of MESOCLOSURE design: in the tropical forest, we examined the impact of MESOCLOSURE dimensions on exclusion efficiency, whereas in the temperate grassland, we assessed the potential for selectively excluding and including community members by different mesh sizes. In the temperate environment, we also went from method to application, using MESOCLOSURES to relate community composition to functioning under two simulated grazing regimes. 3. MESOCLOSURES allowed efficient manipulation of dung beetle communities, maintaining dung beetle densities at intended levels in both temperate and tropical systems. In the tropics, the smallest cages (1x1m) offered the highest contrast in beetle densities inside vs. outside of the fence, whereas the largest cages (9x9m) offered the lowest. Nonetheless, densities inside cages never exceed one-fifth of those outside. At the temperate site, manipulations of community structure through mesh size yielded significant differences in functioning and suggested an interaction between small dung-dwelling species and large tunnelling species. Within cages, higher grazing was reflected in augmented dung removal. 4.We conclude that MESOCLOSURES can be effectively used to study dung beetle functions across habitats and latitudes. As applied insights, the present study adds resolution to the significance of different functional groups of dung beetles and shows that grazing pressure may have an important impact on the ecosystem functions that they provide. Overall, this study suggests that targeted manipulation of dispersal may offer new solutions for linking fauna to ecosystem functions with minimal impact on the processes measured.},

	abstract = {The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, and is currently highly fragmented and disturbed due to human activities. Variation in environmental conditions in the Atlantic Forest can influence the distribution of species, which may show associations with some environmental features. Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) are insects that act in nutrient cycling via organic matter decomposition and have been used for monitoring environmental changes. The aim of this study is to identify associations between the spatial distribution of dung beetle species and Atlantic Forest structure. The spatial distribution of some dung beetle species was associated with structural forest features. The number of species among the sampling sites ranged widely, and few species were found in all remnant areas. Principal coordinates analysis indicated that species composition, abundance and biomass showed a spatially structured distribution, and these results were corroborated by permutational multivariate analysis of variance. The indicator value index and redundancy analysis showed an association of several dung beetle species with some explanatory environmental variables related to Atlantic Forest structure. This work demonstrated the existence of a spatially structured distribution of dung beetles, with significant associations between several species and forest structure in Atlantic Forest remnants from Southern Brazil.

	doi = {10.1038/srep18140},
	abstract = {Agriculture is one of the largest anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs), with dairy and beef production accounting for nearly two-thirds of emissions. Several recent papers suggest that dung beetles may affect fluxes of GHGs from cattle farming. Here, we put these previous findings into context. Using Finland as an example, we assessed GHG emissions at three scales: the dung pat, pasture ecosystem, and whole lifecycle of milk or beef production. At the first two levels, dung beetles reduced GHG emissions by up to 7\% and 12\% respectively, mainly through large reductions in methane (CH4) emissions. However, at the lifecycle level, dung beetles accounted for only a 0.05-0.13\% reduction of overall GHG emissions. This mismatch derives from the fact that in intensive production systems, only a limited fraction of all cow pats end up on pastures, offering limited scope for dung beetle mitigation of GHG fluxes. In contrast, we suggest that the effects of dung beetles may be accentuated in tropical countries, where more manure is left on pastures, and dung beetles remove and aerate dung faster, and that this is thus a key area for future research. These considerations give a new perspective on previous results perspective, and suggest that studies of biotic effects on GHG emissions from dung pats on a global scale are a priority for current research.},

	abstract = {Understanding how species use and persist in agricultural areas is useful for planning conservation efforts at the landscape scale. Information at the population level is scarce, even for organisms, such as dung beetles, that are traditionally used in biodiversity studies to evaluate the effects of anthropic disturbance. Based on multiple mark-recapture events, the description of movement patterns and three population parameters (population size, survival and recruitment) were compared for two dung beetle species (Dichotomius cf. alyattes and Oxysternon conspicillatum) in a fragmented Andean landscape dominated by sun-grown coffee crops. Interspecific differences were detected in movement patterns and in the minimum distance moved across the landscape, with the latter associated with wing loading and species habitat preferences. D. cf. alyattes was captured in both the forest and in sun-grown coffee plots, but tended to limit its movement to patches of forest, while O. conspicillatum covered large distances in short periods of time across the sun-grown coffee crops (ca. 1.7 km/24 h). The population of each species increased during the months of greatest precipitation, prior to the recruitment of new beetles. Given their great capacity for movement, habitat preference and their differential use of the landscape, the species studied can be used as models to evaluate the functional connectivity of Andean landscapes under high anthropic demand. Our results support the idea of the differential response of species to land-use changes, an aspect that should be considered for effective biodiversity conservation and ecosystem functioning in human-dominated landscapes.},

	doi = {10.1111/een.12240},
	abstract = {1. The DEFRA ecosystem services framework was implemented in an entomological context to provide preliminary estimates of the economic value of four key ecosystem service benefits delivered by dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae, Geotrupidae) to the U.K. cattle industry and individual cattle farmers. These benefits included (i) reduced pest flies; (ii) reduced gastrointestinal parasites; (iii) reduced pasture fouling and (iv) increased soil nutrients. 2. A mesocosm experiment was carried out to quantify the impacts of anthelmintic treatment on dung removal by dung beetles when (i) cattle were excreting anthelmintics (which affect dung beetles) in a sufficient concentration to impact dung beetles and (ii) when cattle were not excreting dung containing anthelmintics (which affect dung beetles) in a sufficient concentration to impact dung beetles. 3. Inferring from our mesocosm experiment and existing data, the value of the benefits of dung beetles under current farming practices (and current anthelmintic usage) was estimated. We estimated the potential economic benefits if dung beetles were protected (i) under all entry-level agri-environment schemes; (ii) under organic schemes; or (iii) if farmers stopped treating adult cattle with anthelmintics during the grazing season. 4. While these estimates are preliminary, and should not be treated as definitive values, we suggest that dung beetles may be currently saving the U.K. cattle industry c. 367million each year: c. 354million in conventional systems and c. 13million in organic systems. Annual benefits per cow are greater in organic systems (43.47) pound compared with conventional systems (37.42) pound. 5. Protecting dung beetles under agri-environment schemes could save the U.K. cattle industry an additional 40.2millionyear(-1) pound (4.36 pound per cow), while protecting dung beetles under organic schemes could save 378k pound year(-1) (1.26 pound per cow). The cessation of, largely unnecessary, treatment of adult cattle with anthelmintics could save the U.K. cattle industry an additional 6.2millionyear(-1) pound (1.40 pound per cow) in addition to savings on the anthelmintics themselves. 6. These estimates are based on a large number of underlying assumptions and, thus, may be overestimating or underestimating the economic value of ecosystem services delivered by dung beetles. 7. The potential for using the DEFRA ecosystem services framework in an entomological context is highlighted. These estimates emphasise the contribution of dung beetles as key Ecosystem Service Providers (ESP's) within the U.K. cattle sector and, by extension, emphasise the importance of valuing supporting ecosystem services derived from invertebrates.},

	abstract = {Dung beetle community structures changes due to the effects of destruction, fragmentation, isolation and decrease in tropical forest area, and therefore are considered ecological indicators. In order to assess the influence of type of maize cultivated and associated maize management on dung beetle communities in Atlantic Forest fragments surrounded by conventional and transgenic maize were evaluated 40 Atlantic Forest fragments of different sizes, 20 surrounded by GM maize and 20 surrounded by conventional maize, in February 2013 and 2014 in Southern Brazil. After applying a sampling protocol in each fragment (10 pitfall traps baited with human feces or carrion exposed for 48 h), a total of 3454 individuals from 44 species were captured: 1142 individuals from 38 species in GM maize surrounded fragments, and 2312 from 42 species in conventional maize surrounded fragments. Differences in dung beetle communities were found between GM and conventional maize communities. As expected for fragmented areas, the covariance analysis showed a greater species richness in larger fragments under both conditions; however species richness was greater in fragments surrounded by conventional maize. Dung beetle structure in the forest fragments was explained by environmental variables, fragment area, spatial distance and also type of maize (transgenic or conventional) associated with maize management techniques. In Southern Brazil's scenario, the use of GM maize combined with associated agricultural management may be accelerating the loss of diversity in Atlantic Forest areas, and consequently, important ecosystem services provided by dung beetles may be lost.},

A total of 9,325 specimens were captured, distributed in nine genera and 32 species. The most abundant species were Onthophagus aff. tristis Harold, 1873, Canthidium aff. trinodosum (Boheman, 1858), Canthon aff. fallax Harold, 1868, Canthon lividus Blanchard, 1845 and Deltochilum morbillosum Burmeister, 1848 which represented 65.54\% of the total individuals sampled. The forest showed the highest values of number of individuals and species. The lower richness was observed in the field while the crop showed the lowest abundance of individuals. Scarabaeinae showed qualitative and quantitative differences in their assemblies across vegetation types sampled. The forest showed the highest observed species richness and a fraction of these are unique to this environment, and rarely occurs in other types of ecosystems. In general, the forest has a greater proportion of trophic generalist or copro-necrophagous species in its composition. Another part of this fauna, being largely represented by coprophagous species, is adapted to open environments indicating a change in food guild caused by replacing the forest with pasture. Thus, in a broader context the landscape can play an important role in diversity of dung beetles.},

	abstract = {This is the first study to address the dung beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) diversity in intra-Amazonian savannahs in the state of Roraima, Brazil. Our aim was to survey the dung beetle fauna associated with these savannahs (regionally called `lavrado'), since little is known about the dung beetles from this environment. We conducted three field samples using pitfall traps baited with human dung in savannah areas near the city of Boa Vista during the rainy seasons of 1996, 1997, and 2008. We collected 383 individuals from ten species, wherein six have no previous record in intra-Amazonian savannahs. The most abundant species were Ontherus appendiculatus (Mannerheim, 1829), Canthidium aff. humerale (Germar, 1813), Dichotomius nisus (Olivier, 1789), and Pseudocanthon aff. xanthurus (Blanchard, 1846). We believe that knowing the dung beetles diversity associated with the intra-Amazonian savannahs is ideal for understanding the occurrence and distribution of these organisms in a highly threatened environment, it thus being the first step towards conservation strategy development.},

	abstract = {Extensive cattle ranching is considered to be one of the major causes of environmental degradation particularly in tropical dry forest, one of the most threatened ecosystems worldwide. The transformation of extensive treeless pastures into intensive silvopastoral systems combining pastures, fodder shrubs, and trees has been promoted to rehabilitate degraded lands. This study was conducted to explore the influence of transforming extensive treeless cattle ranches into intensive silvopastoral systems and how this alters dung beetle diversity in a tropical dry forest located at Cesar river valley, Colombia. The study took place in three livestock farms, dung beetles were collected with baited pitfall traps in three land uses: forest, intensive silvopastoral systems and treeless pasture. A total of 5349 beetles belonging to 17 genera and 32 species, were collected. Forests had the highest species richness and abundance values, followed by intensive silvopastoral systems. The latter contained 61\% of the native forest species and supported 36\% more diversity than treeless pastures. Differences in diversity and composition were related mainly to canopy cover and soil cover. Conserving remaining dry forest fragments is crucial for preserving typical dry forest dung beetle assemblages in this region. Intensive silvopastoral systems complement the role of forests as reservoirs of biodiversity and contribute to the landscape-scale conservation of dung beetles. In this particular landscape and at the spatial scale that is relevant for dung beetles, intensive silvopastoral systems provide the benefits of both land sparing and land sharing.

	doi = {10.1016/j.biocon.2015.12.017},
	abstract = {The world's forested landscapes are increasingly fragmented. The effects of fragmentation on community composition have received more attention than the effects on ecological processes, particularly in the tropics. The extent to which populations from forest fragments move (spillover) into surrounding agricultural areas is of particular interest. This process can retain connectivity between populations and alter the rate of beneficial or detrimental ecological functions. We tested whether riparian forest fragments (riparian reserves), are sources of two functionally important invertebrate groups (dung beetles and scavenging ants) within oil palm plantations in Malaysia. We also assessed whether forest fragments enhance rates of associated ecosystem functions (dung and bait removal). We found that oil palm sites with and without adjacent riparian reserves had similar overall beetle and ant communities and functional rates. However, dung beetle species richness, abundance and diversity declined with distance from a riparian reserve, providing evidence for a weak spillover effect. In addition, dung beetle community metrics within a riparian reserve predicted corresponding values in adjacent oil palm areas. These relationships did not hold for dung removal, ant community metrics or bait removal. Taken together, our results indicate that although riparian reserves are an important habitat in their own right, under the conditions in which we sampled they have a limited role as sources of functionally important invertebrates. Crucially, our results suggest that contiguous habitat corridors are important for maintaining connectivity of invertebrate populations, as forest dependent species may not easily be able to disperse through the agricultural matrix.

	abstract = {Dung beetles mediate a variety of important ecosystem services in both natural and human-modified habitats. These services are associated with the exploitation of dung by beetles for breeding and feeding, with different functional groups using dung in different ways. While many studies have considered how individual ecosystem functions and services (primarily dung removal and seed dispersal) are affected by changes in dung beetle diversity, fewer studies have considered the consequences for multiple functions and services. We used manipulative experiments to evaluate the functional efficiency of three species of dung beetles, each representing one of the three functional groups present in temperate Europe. Standardising beetle biomass, we compared single-species treatments to a three-species mixture containing each of the species in equal biomass. We then measured three ecosystem services relevant in supporting pasture-based livestock production systems: dung removal, soil fauna activity, and soil aeration. The presence of dung beetles significantly elevated all three ecosystem services. However, delivery of each service peaked under different treatments, indicating that no single-species assemblage can provide maximum functioning across multiple services. For all three services, the three-species polyculture provided a level of functioning indistinguishable from the most efficient single-species treatment. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple functions and services when assessing the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and suggest that the conservation of functional richness within dung beetle communities could play an important role in securing the delivery of multiple ecosystem services.

	abstract = {Identifying the drivers shaping biological assemblages in fragmented tropical landscapes is critical for designing effective conservation strategies. It is still unclear, however, whether tropical biodiversity is more strongly affected by forest loss, by its spatial configuration or by matrix composition across different spatial scales. Assessing the relative influence of forest patch and landscape attributes on dung beetle assemblages in the fragmented Lacandona rainforest, Mexico. Using a multimodel inference approach we tested the relative impact of forest patch size and landscape forest cover (measures of forest amount at the patch and landscape scales, respectively), patch shape and isolation (forest configuration indices at the patch scale), forest fragmentation (forest configuration index at the landscape scale), and matrix composition on the diversity, abundance and biomass of dung beetles. Patch size, landscape forest cover and matrix composition were the best predictors of dung beetle assemblages. Species richness, beetle abundance, and biomass decreased in smaller patches surrounded by a lower percentage of forest cover, and in landscapes dominated by open-area matrices. Community evenness also increased under these conditions due to the loss of rare species. Forest loss at the patch and landscape levels and matrix composition show a larger impact on dung beetles than forest spatial configuration. To preserve dung beetle assemblages, and their key functional roles in the ecosystem, conservation initiatives should prioritize a reduction in deforestation and an increase in the heterogeneity of the matrix surrounding forest remnants.},

Two main findings deserve special attention: (i) forest amount at the patch (patch size) and landscape scales (landscape forest cover) showed a stronger impact on dung beetles than forest configuration at the patch (patch shape, patch isolation) and landscape scales (degree of landscape fragmentation); and (ii) landscape composition (percentage of forest cover and percentage of the matrix covered by cattle pastures and annual crops) had higher explanatory value than landscape configuration (degree of fragmentation). Therefore, our results support the idea that species’ persistence and distribution in fragmented landscapes are more strongly affected by attributes related to forest loss across spatial scales and by landscape composition, than by those related to patch and landscape configuration (e.g., Fahrig 2003; Ethier and Fahrig 2011; Smith et al. 2011).” (Sanchez-de-Jesus et al., 2016, p. 850)

	abstract = {Context In tropical landscapes, dominant land-use changes involve conversion of intact forest to an agricultural matrix with embedded fragments of remnant forest. However, most research to date has focused on how these land-use changes affect species within the fragmented ecosystem, rather than the flux of energy and nutrients within these different landscape elements. Objectives We examined how forest fragmentation and conversion to orange fields impact the potential for litter decomposition in a Costa Rican landscape, in particular via effects on macroinvertebrates (MIs) and microclimate. Methods We measured mass losses of a standard leaf litter in four habitats: orange fields, small forest fragments, large forest fragments and intact forest. Litter bags were constructed of mesh that either excluded or allowed MIs. Decomposition rates were measured in wet and dry seasons, and at different distances from the forest edge. Results Forest fragmentation and forest conversion had divergent effects on decomposition rates. Decomposition rates were 7 \% slower in forest fragments during the dry season than in intact forest, and this result was mediated by forest fragmentation effects on MIs. Decomposition rates were 9 \% higher in orange fields during the wet season, relative to intact forest, and this pattern was explained by effects of the litter microenvironment on leaching rates or smaller invertebrates. Fragment area and distance from forest edge had minor or undetectable effects on decomposition in fragments. Conclusions We conclude that land-use changes affect decomposition processes in both forest and agroecosystems, and these effects can vary in mechanism and direction across disturbed landscapes.},

	abstract = {7 Both the impact of habitat modification on the food preferences of species and its impact on ecosystem functioning are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed food selection by dung beetles in 80 tropical forest fragments and their adjacent cattle pastures in the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. Ten pitfall traps were placed at each site, half baited with human dung and the other half with fish carrion. We assessed dung beetle food selection and classified any specialization in resource use quantitatively using a multinomial classification model. We collected 15,445 beetles belonging to 42 species, 8747 beetles (38 species) in forest fragments and 6698 beetles (29 species) in cattle pastures. Twenty-five species were present in both habitats. Of all the beetles captured, 76\% were caught in dung traps (11,727 individuals) and 24\% in carrion traps (318 individuals). We found 21 species of dung specialists, 7 carrion specialists, 8 generalists, and 6 species too rare to classify. The bait most frequently selected by beetles in this study was dung in both forests and pastures. Specialists tended to remain specialists in both habitats, while generalists tended to change their selection of bait type depending on the habitat. In summary, our results show that replacing forests with cattle pastures modifies the patterns of resource selection by dung beetles and this could affect ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the most diverse environments, but it is also one of the most threatened areas in terms of loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Assessment of changes in the community structure during the recovery of forests can be performed using indicator organisms. Dung beetles perform several ecological functions and show high sensitivity to natural and anthropogenic environmental changes. This study aimed to investigate the effect of regeneration time of Atlantic Forest sites on structure of Scarabaeinae assemblages. We sampled dung beetles using ten baited pitfall traps per site, in six sites grouped into three classes of forest regeneration time (similar to 30, similar to 60 and ¿ 80 years) in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest, during January 2015. A total of 520 individuals belonging to 16 species and nine genera of dung beetles were sampled. Rarefied species richness did not differ between sites with different regeneration times. Average species richness and abundance of Scarabaeinae was smaller in areas of shorter recovery time. True alpha diversity was higher in areas with intermediate recovery whereas Shannon diversity showed higher values in areas of shorter recovery. Approximately 29 \% of the variation in abundance data of Scarabaeinae was explained by environmental variables, with one-third of this variation explained also by spatial predictors. External factors such as landscape management and farming practices in the surroundings must be taken into consideration in management plans and the management of natural areas for the recovery of biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest. These external factors can considerably affect the structure of communities and lead to scenarios of greater diversity in intermediate regeneration sites due to the heterogeneity of the landscape.},

	abstract = {AimIn this study, we investigate whether anthropogenic land use and habitat fragmentation lead to a process of either homogenization (decreasing spatial replacement and increasing nestedness) or divergence (increasing spatial replacement and decreasing nestedness) of dung beetle assemblages in edge-affected habitats. LocationA fragmented landscape of the Atlantic forest of north-east Brazil. MethodsWe investigate the extent to which beta diversity of dung beetle assemblages varies in edge-affected habitats at different spatial scales (i.e. traps along an interior-exterior nonlinear gradient, within and among habitats). We compare species replacement and nestedness of dung beetle assemblages using (1) multiple dissimilarity measures accounting for compositional heterogeneity across forest (i.e. forest edges, core primary forest areas and small fragments) and matrix habitats (i.e. sugar cane plantations and pastures) and (2) distance matrices accounting for the multivariate structure of dissimilarity. Results(1) Each habitat supported a distinct dung beetle assemblage; (2) there was a strong influence of anthropogenic land use and fragmentation-related effects on dung beetle -diversity, with species replacements increasing in edge-affected and matrix habitats providing support for the divergence hypothesis at all spatial scales; (3) edge effects enhanced species replacement across assemblages; (4) dung beetle assemblages were not randomly distributed, with habitat type leading to a strongly nested pattern of species composition; and (5) both dung beetle replacement and nestedness were not correlated with geographic distance, whereby neighbouring sites were not necessarily more similar in their community composition. Main conclusionsSpecies replacement is strongly influenced by habitat configuration and -diversity increases in edge-affected habitats. Accordingly, anthropogenic land use and habitat fragmentation clearly promote community-level taxonomic divergence in human-modified landscapes. Landscape-scale divergence likely results from a non-random distribution of both forest-dependent and disturbance-adapted species across all habitats, which are in marked contrast in terms of suitability.},

	abstract = {Many ecosystem services are sustained by the combined action of microscopic and macroscopic organisms, and shaped by interactions between the two. However, studies tend to focus on only one of these two components. We combined the two by investigating the impact of macrofauna on microbial community composition and functioning in the context of a major ecosystem process: the decomposition of dung. We compared bacterial communities of pasture soil and experimental dung pats inhabited by one (Aphodius), two (Aphodius and Geotrupes), or no dung beetle genera. Overall, we found distinct microbial communities in soil and dung samples, and that the communities converged over the course of the experiment. Characterising the soil microbial communities underlying the dung pats revealed a significant interactive effect between the microflora and macrofauna, where the diversity and composition of microbial communities was significantly affected by the presence or absence of dung beetles. The specific identity of the beetles had no detectable impact, but the microbial evenness was lower in the presence of both Aphodius and Geotrupes than in the presence of Aphodius alone. Differences in microbial community composition were associated with differences in substrate usage as measured by Ecoplates. Moreover, microbial communities with similar compositions showed more similar substrate usage. Our study suggests that the presence of macrofauna (dung beetles) will modify the microflora (bacteria) of both dung pats and pasture soil, including community diversity and functioning. In particular, the presence of dung beetles promotes the transfer of bacteria across the soil-dung interface, resulting in increased similarity in community structure and functioning. The results demonstrate that to understand how microbes contribute to the ecosystem process of dung decomposition, there is a need to understand their interactions with larger co-occurring fauna.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of habitat loss and forest replacement by cattle pasture on the alpha and beta diversity, abundance, biomass and species composition of dung beetles with different dispersal ability. Dung beetles were captured in 19 forest fragments and neighbouring pastures. Forest fragment area ranged from 3.7 to 4825 ha and in this study were grouped into four categories: small, medium, large and control forest. A total of 35,048 dung beetles representing 101 species were collected. Forest fragments had the highest richness with 81 species, followed by pasture with 58 species. Replacement of forest by pasture reduced species richness; however, due to the proximity and connectivity of these areas with Cerrado patches, pastures also had high species richness, but species composition was independent of adjacent fragments. Small fragments had lower abundance and species richness than our other habitat categories, even pastures. Our results highlight that proximity and connectivity with Cerrado areas influenced the patterns of alpha and beta diversity of dung beetles in fragments and pastures. We highlight that the ability to cross the pasture matrix is a strong adaptive trait for species living in human-modified landscapes. Consequently, species with these abilities are less susceptible to the effects of forest fragmentation and local extinction. Our results reinforce the importance of considering the biogeographic location and distribution pattern of species in forest fragmentation studies.},

	abstract = {Southern Africa's grassland biodiversity is threatened by habitat transformation such as commercial forestry. Ecological networks (ENs) have been instigated to alleviate the pressure of habitat transformation on local biodiversity. ENs are large scale webs of corridors and patches of natural vegetation criss-crossing production landscapes that can simulate conditions in protected areas (PAs). Many ENs have lost many native large mammal species, which have been replaced by domestic livestock to retain natural grazing dynamics, which could have an impact on the long-term value of ENs for insects. Here we compared dung beetle, butterfly and grasshopper diversity in ENs across a landscape mosaic of timber plantations, where 1) wild megaherbivores were maintained, 2) in ENs where these herbivores were replaced by livestock and, 3) in a nearby World Heritage PA which retained its natural complement of megaherbivores. Sites in the PA far from any plantation were similar in composition to those in the wild grazed EN. Presence of the wild grazers improved the alpha-and beta-diversity of all focal insect taxa when compared to domestic grazing. Furthermore, species composition shows significant differences between the two grazing systems indicating that an assemblage of native large mammals facilitates insect diversity conservation. We support the maintenance or introduction of large native mammals in ENs or similar conservation areas in production landscapes to simulate the ecological conditions and natural heterogeneity in nearby PAs.},

	abstract = {While substantial effort has been invested in modelling changes in species distribution with climate change, less attention has been given to how climate warming will affect interactions among co-occurring species, and the cascading functional consequences. In this study, realistic dung beetle communities were subjected to an experimental warming treatment and the net effect on the functions of dung decomposition (in terms of dung mass) and plant productivity (in terms of biomass production of ryegrass grown on soil from underneath the dung pats) were examined. A priori, we hypothesized that the largest tunneling species would be functionally dominant, and be differently affected by experimental warming compared to pat-dwelling, smaller species. In terms of dung decomposition, the largest beetles did prove to be the functionally most important, with the qualitative pattern unaffected by experimental warming. In contrast, for plant productivity all species appeared equally important under ambient conditions. However, the effects of single species on plant productivity were reduced as temperature increased: In a warmed climate, a combination of both tunneling and pat-dwelling species came the closest to returning ecosystem functioning to levels found in the ambient treatment. These results suggest different roles for different species, and highlight the importance of maintaining multiple species within an ecosystem - particularly when systems are perturbed.},

	doi = {10.1111/aec.12366},
	abstract = {The impacts of land use change on biodiversity and ecosystem functions are variable, particularly in fragmented tropical rainforest systems with high diversity. Dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) are an ideal group to investigate the relationship between land use change, diversity and ecosystem function as they are easily surveyed, sensitive to habitat modification and perform many ecosystem functions. Although this relationship has been investigated for dung beetles in some tropical regions, there has been no study assessing how native dung beetles in Australia's tropical rainforests respond to deforestation, and what the corresponding consequences are for dung removal (a key ecosystem function fulfilled by dung beetles). In this study we investigated the relationship between dung beetle community attributes (determined through trapping) and function (using dung removal experiments that allowed different dung beetle functional groups to access the dung) in rainforest and cleared pasture in a tropical landscape in Australia's Wet Tropics. Species richness, abundance and biomass were higher in rainforest compared to adjacent pasture, and species composition between these land use types differed significantly. However, average body size and evenness in body size were higher in pasture than in rainforest. Dung removal was higher in rainforest than in pasture when both functional groups or tunnelers only could access the dung. Increased dung removal in the rainforest was explained by higher biodiversity and dominance of a small number of species with distinct body sizes, as dung removal was best predicted by the evenness in body size of the community. Our findings suggest that functional traits (including body size and dung relocation behaviour) present in a dung beetle community are key drivers of dung removal. Overall, our results show that deforestation has reduced native dung beetle diversity in Australian tropical landscapes, which negatively impacts on the capacity for dung removal by dung beetles in this region.},

	abstract = {Phanaeini is a neotropical tribe of scarabs mostly dung or carrion feeders, generally of large size. This paper analyses data collected with large window flight interception traps set on nine forest sites in French Guiana with a primary goal of biotic inventory. The study deals with three main questions: 1) What is the spatial structure of communities and are there some species indicators of secondary forests and others of pristine conditions? 2) What is the temporal structure of the community and is there a stable pattern of seasonality between years and sites? 3) Between close species, is there a temporal asynchrony? Our samples contain more than 9,700 identified specimens, nine complete year series on four sites including a four years continuous survey near Cayenne. We found a significantly lower diversity (Shannon and Simpson index) on the most fragmented and hunted sites. A more equitable repartition of species and a relative abundance of the larger species appear typical of undisturbed sites. Other observations reinforce the hypothesis that there is a fast and huge modification in Phanaeini community structure on the most accessible and disturbed sites. Seasonal pattern shows an abundance peak at the beginning of the rainy season (December or January), a medium abundance during the rainy season with sometimes secondary peaks and a low to very low activity during the dry season. The pattern is rather consistent between years but changes with sampling site. It is however different from the results of other studies using pitfall baited traps in Amazonian and Guyanese forests. These studies show much less clear temporal pattern or no seasonal change. There is no obvious pattern of niche sharing by phenological differences between species. The methodological differences of sampling between baited traps and window flight traps are eventually discussed. Due to its passive way of collecting, interception trap is considered as quite relevant for studying flight activity spatio-temporal patterns of Scarabaeinae. This aspect may explain some differences in seasonality patterns compared to other studies.},

	abstract = {Scarab beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) have been used to investigate the effects of environmental disturbances on forest structure and diversity. This group is recognized as sensitive to habitat perturbations and ecosystem changes. Here we examine the effects of anthropogenic impacts on Scarabaeidae composition, testing the following hypotheses: (1) Scarab beetle communities react to land use disturbances with predictable trends, (2) disturbed habitats are able to retain only a part of the Scarab beetle community of native forests or late secondary forests; (3) habitats largely differ in terms of species richness, taxonomic diversity and ecological composition, supporting exclusive and indicator species. We selected areas of native forest, agriculture, pasture for extensive livestock and secondary forests in different stages of regeneration. Our results show that the Scarabaeidae species were not indifferent to the gradient of structural changes represented by the studied areas. In fact, their patterns of habitat preference reveals communities more abundant and diverse in pristine habitats. In contrast, disturbed habitats, dominated by agricultural activities and pasture, indicated clear detrimental effects on the abundance of all forest Scarab beetle specialists. On the other hand, the generalist species, mainly associated with open environments, seemed to be favoured by the prevailing conditions induced by agricultural activities. Overall, the composition of the Scarab beetle communities is variable and sensitive to those structural gradients and, therefore, capable of responding as useful ecological indicators for assessing the extent of land use change or degradation.

	doi = {10.7717/peerj.3125},
	abstract = {Background. Conserving biodiversity in tropical landscapes is a major challenge to scientists and conservationists. Current rates of deforestation, fragmentation, and land use intensification are producing variegated landscapes with undetermined values for the conservation of biological communities and ecosystem functioning. Here, we investigate the importance of tropical variegated landscapes to biodiversity conservation, using dung beetle as focal taxa. Methods. The study was carried out in 12 variegated landscapes where dung beetles were sampled using six pitfall traps, 30 m apart from each other, along a transect in each studied landscape use and cover classes -LUCC (forest fragment and corridor, coffee plantation, and pasture). We baited each pitfall trap with 30 g of human feces and left open for a 48 h period. We also measured three environmental variables reflecting structural differences among the studied classes: canopy cover, local vegetation heterogeneity and soil sand content. Results. We collected 52 species and 2,695 individuals of dung beetles. We observed significant differences in the mean species richness, abundance and biomass among classes, with forest fragments presenting the highest values, forest corridors and coffee plantations presenting intermediate values, and pastures the lowest values. Regarding community structure, we also found significant differences among classes. Canopy cover was the only variable explaining variation in dung beetle species richness, abundance, biomass, and community structure. The relative importance of spatial turnover was greater than nestedness-resultant component in all studied landscapes. Discussion. This study evaluated the ecological patterns of dung beetle communities in variegated tropical landscapes highlighting the importance of these landscapes for conservation of tropical biodiversity. However, we encourage variegation for the management of landscapes that have already been fragmented or as a complementary initiative of current conservation practices (e.g., protection of natural habitats and establishment of reserves).},

	abstract = {The Edge Influence is one of the most pervasive effects of habitat fragmentation, as many forest remnants in anthropogenic landscapes are within 100 m of edges. Forest remnants may also affect the surrounding anthropogenic matrix, possibly resulting in a matrix-edge-remnant diversity gradient for some species groups. We sampled dung beetles in 15 agricultural landscapes using pitfall traps placed along transects in matrix-edge-remnant gradients. The remnants were a native savanna-like vegetation, the cerrado, and the matrix was composed of three human-dominated environments (sugarcane, eucalyptus, pasture). More species were observed in cerrado remnants than in adjacent land uses. Dung beetles were also more abundant in the cerrado than in the landscape matrix of sugarcane and eucalypt, but not of pasture. Dung beetles were severely affected by anthropogenic land uses, and notwithstanding their high abundance in some land uses such as pasture, the species richness in these areas tended to be smaller than in the cerrado remnants. We also found that the influence of the edge was evident only for abundance, particularly in landscapes with a pasture matrix. However, this land use disrupts the species composition of communities, indicating that communities located in cerrado and pasture have a distinct species composition, and that both communities are affected by edge distance. Thus, anthropogenic land uses may severely affect dung beetles, and this impact can extend to communities located in cerrado remnants as well as to those in matrices, with possible consequences for ecological processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling.},

The present study evaluated the seasonal patterns of dung beetles in a range of increasingly disturbed ecosystems of the state of Para, northern Brazil, to identify valuable disturbance indicators. The areas included native forest, agriculture, pasture for extensive livestock grazing and secondary forests. Fieldwork was carried out encompassing the complete range of environmental conditions encountered during the year. In total, 13,649 individuals were captured within 23 genera and 99 species but with pronounced differences among ecosystems and seasons. The obtained results seem to demonstrate that dung beetles can be used to help identify ecosystems under very complex and variable environmental conditions. The ecological drift observed also demonstrates the possibility of using dung beetles as ecological indicators of disturbance in Amazonia.},

	abstract = {1. The impacts of human activities on tropical forests are widespread and increasing. Hence, a good knowledge base about ecological processes in undisturbed tropical forest is crucial to provide a baseline for evaluating anthropogenic change. 2. Our 5-year study focused on understanding the background spatial and inter-annual variation in dung beetle communities at 12 sites of undisturbed lowland tropical rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon. We then assessed how this variation may affect ecological evaluations of anthropogenic influence by comparing community metrics with comparable dung beetle data collected from 15 sites of Eucalyptus plantation in the same region. 3. Of all measured environmental variables, soil texture best explained spatial variation in dung beetle communities in undisturbed forests. Furthermore, soil texture was important for community assembly as it was associated with dung beetle nesting behaviours. While the relative abundance of dung beetle functional groups was stable over time, there were important inter-annual temporal dynamics, with a fivefold variation in abundance and body mass, and with species richness ranging from 52 to 74. These temporal oscillations were probably caused by variation in dry season rainfall. 4. This inter-annual variation influenced the comparison between undisturbed forests and plantations, which could lead to inconsistencies in evaluation of anthropogenic change. We therefore highlight the importance of understanding natural variation in studies evaluating the consequences of land-use change and other forest disturbances on forest biodiversity.},

Therefore, a comparison of the spatio-temporal variation of copro-necrophagous beetles assemblage (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) was conducted between forest patches and their adjacent matrix (cropland, paddocks, living fences) in 3 locations (Corrales de San Luis [CSL], Reserva Campesina La Montana [RCM] y Reserva Bijibana [RB]). Two samplings were carried out in each season (first rains, heavy rains and dry) and for every forest patch and adjacent matrix 10 pitfall traps were buried. A total of 34,170 beetles was collected belonging to 15 genera and 32 species. The analysis of interpolation and extrapolation showed that the highest diversity values are found during the first rains in the living fences of RCM with 22 species and the lowest values were observed in cropland and pasture of CSL during the dry season (2 species). The ANOSIM test proved that forest patches have differences in the composition and structure of Scarabaeinae community in relation to the other habitats with anthropic impact.

	abstract = {Landscape ecological networks (ENs) consist of landscape-scale conservation corridors that connect areas of high natural value within a production mosaic with protected areas (PAs). In South Africa, ENs have been implemented on a large spatial scale to offset the negative impacts of plantation forestry on indigenous grasslands. We focus on corridor width as a factor for conserving dung beetle and ant diversity within an EN. We also investigate the importance of natural environmental heterogeneity (elevation, vegetation type) and habitat quality (soil hardness, invasive alien plant density). We sampled dung beetles and ants in 30 corridors of different sizes, and at ten sites in a nearby PA. In addition, we also analysed dung beetles according to their feeding guild. Tunnelling dung beetle species richness increased with corridor width. Rolling dung beetle species richness was higher in the PA than in the corridors of the EN. The dung beetle assemblage within the EN differed from that within the PA. Corridors of various widths differed in ant composition but not in species richness. Furthermore, the PA and the EN differed in environmental variables, which contributed to differences in dung beetle species richness and assemblage composition. Within the EN, environmental heterogeneity across the landscape was more important than corridor width for driving species diversity of both dung beetles and ants. When planning future ENs, wide corridors (¿ 280 m) that encompass as much natural heterogeneity across the landscape as possible will best conserve the range of local insect species.},

	doi = {10.1111/gcb.13616},
	abstract = {Today, indigenous forests cover less than 0.6\% of South Africa's land surface and are highly fragmented. Most forest relicts are very small and typically occur in fire-protected gorges along the eastern Great Escarpment. Yet, they hold a unique and valuable fauna with high endemism and ancient phylogenetic lineages, fostered by long-term climatic stability and complex microclimates. Despite numerous studies on southern African vegetation cover, the current state of knowledge about the natural extension of indigenous forests is rather fragmentary. We use an integrated approach of population-level phylogeography and climatic niche modeling of forest-associated chafer species to assess connectivity and extent of forest habitats since the last glacial maximum. Current and past species distribution models ascertained potential fluctuations of forest distribution and supported a much wider potential current extension of forests based on climatic data. Considerable genetic admixture of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA among many populations and an increase in mean population mutation rate in Extended Bayesian Skyline Plots of all species indicated more extended or better connected forests in the recent past (¡ 5 kya). Genetic isolation of certain populations, as revealed by population differentiation statistics (G'(ST)), as well as landscape connectivity statistics and habitat succession scenarios suggests considerable loss of habitat connectivity. As major anthropogenic influence is likely, conservational actions need to be considered.},

	volume = {98},

	doi = {10.1002/ecy.1954},
	abstract = {Studies investigating how biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning increasingly focus on multiple functions measured simultaneously (multifunctionality). However, few such studies assess the role of species interactions, particularly under alternative environmental scenarios, despite interactions being key to ecosystem functioning. Here we address five questions of central importance to ecosystem multifunctionality using a terrestrial animal system. (1) Does the contribution of individual species differ for different ecosystem functions? (2) Do inter-species interactions affect the delivery of single functions and multiple functions? (3) Does the community composition that maximizes individual functions also maximize multifunctionality? (4) Is the functional role of individual species, and the effect of interspecific interactions, modified by changing environmental conditions? (5) How do these roles and interactions change under varying scenarios where ecosystem services are weighted to reflect different societal preferences? We manipulated species' relative abundance in dung beetle communities and measured 16 functions contributing to dung decomposition, plant productivity, nutrient recycling, reduction of greenhouse gases, and microbial activity. Using the multivariate diversity-interactions framework, we assessed how changes in species identity, composition, and interspecific interactions affected these functions in combination with an environmental driver (increased precipitation). This allowed us to identify key species and interactions across multiple functions. We then developed a desirability function approach to examine how individual species and species mixtures contribute to a desired state of overall ecosystem functioning. Species contributed unequally to individual functions, and to multifunctionality, and individual functions were maximized by different community compositions. Moreover, the species and interactions important for maintaining overall multifunctionality depended on the weight given to individual functions. Optimal multifunctionality was context-dependent, and sensitive to the valuation of services. This combination of methodological approaches allowed us to resolve the interactions and indirect effects among species that drive ecosystem functioning, revealing how multiple aspects of biodiversity can simultaneously drive ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight the importance of a multifunctionality perspective for a complete assessment of species' functional contributions.},

In this work the responses of the Rove Beetles to gradients of disturbance in representative ecosystems of the Brazilian Amazon were evaluated. Specifically, we assessed the possibility of using patterns in richness, abundance and taxonomic diversity of Rove Beetles as anthropogenic disturbance indicators. The obtained results show that the Rove Beetles richness was sensitive to the structural changes induced by increasing anthropogenic disturbance. Additionally an increasing trend in community complexity from more to less disturbed ecosystems was observed. Differences in responses can be explained by differences in the intensity and extent of the change from pristine systems. Overall, the composition of Rove Beetles communities is ecosystems' specific and sensitive to anthropogenic induced structural changes and management actions and, therefore, should be considered a valuable ecological indicator for assessing the extent ecosystems' disruption in the Neotropics.},

	abstract = {The effects of transgenic compounds on non-target organisms remain poorly understood, especially in native insect species. Morphological changes (e.g., changes in body size and shape) may reflect possible responses to environmental stressors, like transgenic toxins. The dung beetle Canthon quinquemaculatus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) is a non-target species found in transgenic crops. We evaluated whether C. quinquemaculatus individuals inhabiting corn fields cultivated with different seed types (conventional, creole and transgenic) present modifications in body shape compared to individuals inhabiting adjacent native forest fragments. We collected C. quinquemaculatus specimens across an agricultural landscape in southern Brazil, during the summer of 2015. Six populations were sampled: three maize crop populations each under a different seed type, and three populations of adjacent forests. After sampling, specimens were subjected to morphometric analyses to discover differences in body shape. We chose fifteen landmarks to describe body shape, and morphometric data were tested with Procrustes ANOVA and Discriminant Analysis. We found that body shape did not differ between individuals collected in conventional and creole crops with their respective adjacent forests (p ¿ 0.05); however, transgenic crop populations differed significantly from those collected in adjacent forests (p ¡ 0.05). Insects in transgenic maize are more oval and have a retraction in the abdominal region, compared with the respective adjacent forest, this result shows the possible effect of transgenic crops on non-target species. This may have implications for the ecosystem service of organic matter removal, carried out by these organisms.},

They perform a variety of functions and are sensitive to environmental disturbances. Chiapas is one of the regions with the largest number of Scarabaeinae records in Mexico, but there are still extensive areas with little knowledge about this group of insects, including some protected natural areas, such as the Selva El Ocote Biosphere Reserve. Copronecrophagous beetle assemblages, product of five systematic sampling during 2011 and 2012 in three representative habitats of the reserve, were analyzed. The collections were made using pitfall traps using squid, pig dung and cow dung as attractants. 5421 beetles were collected from six tribes, 12 genera and 37 species. The sampling coverage was close to 100 \% and the evaluations indicate that the Selva had the closest to the estimated richness while the coffee plantation is the habitat with greater possibility of adding species to the inventory. The values of beta diversity suggest that the faunas of the three habitats are part of a single community of beetles, but the composition of the trophic guilds is different in all of them. The fauna obtained constitutes 31.1 \% of the species recorded in Chiapas. This work represents the first study by systematic sampling in the Selva El Ocote Biosphere Reserve.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.foreco.2017.04.043},
	abstract = {Agroforestry systems have increased in area in tropical regions in recent decades and many studies have sought to evaluate their impact on native biodiversity. Yet, few have assessed the impact of perennial plantations such as rubber-tree harvesting on native biodiversity. The goal of our study was to assess the effect of rubber tree plantations on fruit-feeding butterflies of the endangered Brazilian Atlantic Forest in Brazil. To do so, we sampled fruit-feeding butterfly species in a landscape mosaic composed of primary forest, rubber tree plantations under two management regimes (active production with intense management and undergrowth suppression and low management plantations with no undergrowth suppression), and forest fragments immersed in rubber tree plantation matrix. By trap-baiting butterflies for a year, we captured 5800 individuals of 85 butterfly species. Species richness was higher in unmanaged (no growth suppression) plantation and forest fragments (57-60 species) and lower in managed plantation (with growth suppression) (47) and primary forest (43). Ordination analysis suggests three main community groups formed by primary forest samples, a cluster combining unmanaged plantation and fragments, and managed plantation. There was substantial variation in butterfly abundance in the landscape, but our data suggest that several forest specialists species are able to occur along the mosaic on the landscape, and despite differences in management the entire landscape can contribute for a rich biota. Loss of understory vegetation led to simplified communities, with skewed dominance of a few species. By allowing understory development, a low impact management can provide adequate habitat for native butterflies. Yet, current rubber tree plantation technology does not normally use this method, opting to use the high management approach instead. We hypothesize that these minimally benign plantations may serve as conduits for butterflies in forest patches. Thus, we suggest that rubber tree plantations near Atlantic forest fragments should encourage understory development and establish a landscape mosaic, allowing forest fragments immersed in plantation matrix to be able to exchange individuals and colonize more complex plantation habitat. Intensive suppression of undergrowth should be avoided, except for trail maintenance, and isolation of fragments in this matrix should be kept to a minimum. If undergrowth suppression cannot be avoided, then establishment of stepping stones in plantation matrix should be encouraged to reduce isolation of fragments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The Caatinga is a semiarid ecosystem that undergoes continual environmental disturbances through outdated production technologies and deregulated use of its natural landscapes. Bioindicators, such as dung beetles, are successfully used to understand processes of forest disturbance and subsequent regeneration. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the dung beetle assemblage of a region of the Caatinga with fragments at initial, intermediate, and late stages of regeneration. Sampling was conducted in forest remnants of northeastern Brazil between 2011 and 2013 during the dry and rainy seasons, using traps baited with dung and carrion. There were no differences in beetle richness and abundance according to stage of regeneration. However, there was higher abundance in carrion traps and during the rainy season, which also presented higher richness compared to the dry season. There was a difference in species composition among the fragments in late regeneration. Deltochilum irroratum (Laporte) and Canthon aff. simulans Martinez occurred predominantly in fragments with late regeneration. The harsh conditions and scarcity of resources in Caatinga during the dry season seem to be important factors that limit the activity of these beetles. As this ecosystem has high evapotranspiration rates, carrion, which is less ephemeral than dung, could be an important resource for the beetles, justifying the higher abundance attracted to this resource. Our results suggest that D. irroratum and C. aff. simulans have a strict distribution in conserved habitats and could be evaluated as indicator species of this ecosystem in future studies.},

	abstract = {Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) are considered essential for enhancing the physicochemical characteristics of soils, principally by changing organic materials (e.g. dead animals, faeces, fruits e leaf litter). This study compared the species richness and abundance of dung beetles captured using various types of baits, to demonstrate attractiveness differences in variable habitats of the Brazilian Amazon. Samplings were carried out with pitfall traps baited with human faeces, rotten banana, rotten meat and a non baited trap, in February, March, June, September and October 2015. Habitats included native forests, agriculture areas, pastures and disturbed forests in different regeneration stages. A total of 13 736 Scarabaeinae beetles were captured, distributed over 98 species. Most individuals were captured using traps baited with faeces (76.7 \% of individuals), followed by rotten meat baited traps (17.8 \% of individuals), fermented banana baited traps (3.9 \% of individuals) and finally by non-baited traps (1.6 \% of individuals). A significant difference in attractiveness of the different baits used and habitats types was observed. Most of the captured assemblages were composed by coprophagous (42 \%), generalist species (32 \%), necrophagous (15 \%) and none was classified as saprophagous. Approximately 54 \% of the specimens were tunnelers, 25 \% were rollers and 12 \% were dwellers. The species of Scarabaeinae sampled in the region revealed qualitative and quantitative differences among their assemblages and the phytophysiognomies. The forest environments housed the greatest species richness observed, and a fraction of these is exclusive of those areas. We concluded that some species of Scarabaeinae have an important potential as disturbance indicators in the Amazonian ecosystem.},

	volume = {42},

	doi = {10.1111/een.12421},
	abstract = {1. The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is typically positive but saturating, suggesting widespread functional redundancy within ecological communities, However, theory predicts that apparent redundancy can be reduced or removed when systems are perturbed, or when multifunctionality (the simultaneous delivery of multiple functions) is considered. 2. Manipulative experiments were used to test whether higher levels of dung beetle species richness enhanced individual functions and multifunctionality, and whether these relationships were influenced by perturbation (in this case, non-target exposure to the veterinary anthclmintic ivermectin). The four ecosystem functions tested were dung removal, primary productivity, soil faunal feeding activity and reduction in soil bulk density. 3. For individual functions, perturbation had limited effects on functioning, with only dung removal significantly (negatively) affected. Species richness did not, on its own, explain significant variation in the delivery of individual functions. In the case of primary productivity, an interaction between richness and perturbation was found: species-rich dung beetle assemblages enhanced forage growth in the unperturbed treatment, relative to the perturbed treatment. 4. Using a composite `multifunctionality index' it was found that species-rich dung beetle assemblages delivered marginally higher levels of multifunctionality in unperturbed conditions; however, this benefit was lost, under perturbation, Using a relatively new and robust method of assessing diversity multifunctionality relationships across a range of thresholds, no significant effect of species richness on multifunctionality was found.},

	abstract = {In detritus-based trophic systems, springtails, dung beetles, saprophagous calyptrate flies and termites consume and fragment organic matter and control populations of decomposer microorganisms, exerting a strong influence on energy and nutrient fluxes. A faunal inventory of these four groups of hexapods was performed in Serra de Santa Catarina (SSC), an area of arboreal-shrub caatinga located in the state of Paraiba, with the purpose of characterizing the assemblages of these taxa, and highlighting their unique links to the local ecosystem. Samplings were performed in May, 2014, and April, 2015, both during the rainy season. Standard sampling protocols for biodiversity inventory of the various taxa were used, including both active and passive sampling methods. In general, 114 species of hexapods were captured, with 26 species of springtails, 20 dung beetles, 30 saprophagous calyptrate flies and 38 termites, with sampling sufficiency varying from 69.5 to 96.8\% of total estimated richness. Species richness of the groups are among the highest recorded for a single area of Caatinga, with some taxa being recorded for the first time for the domain. Several morphospecies had indeterminate taxonomic status, especially springtails and termites, and are quite likely new species to science. The structure of the assemblages of springtails, dung beetles, saprophagous calyptrate flies and termites recorded in SSC, suggest that this conserved area is unique within the highly impacted landscape of Caatinga, and has great potential for the conservation of biodiversity of this domain in the Northeast Region of Brazil.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.baae.2017.09.006},
	abstract = {Insects play a key role in the regulation and dynamics of many ecosystem services (ES). However, this role is often assumed, with limited or no experimental quantification of its real value. We examined publication trends in the research on ES provided by insects, ascertaining which ES and taxa have been more intensively investigated, and which methodologies have been used, with particular emphasis on experimental approaches. We first performed a systematic literature search to identify which ES have been attributed to insects. Then we classified the references retrieved according to the ES, taxonomic group and ecosystem studied, as well as to the method applied to quantify each ES (in four categories: no quantification, proxies, direct quantification and experiments). Pollination, biological control, food provisioning, and recycling organic matter are the most studied ES. However, the majority of papers do not specify the ES under consideration, and from those that do, most do not quantify the ES provided. From the rest, a large number of publications use proxies as indicators for ES, assuming or inferring their provision through indirect measurements such as species abundances, species density, species richness, diversity indices, or the number of functional groups. Pollinators, predators, parasitoids, herbivores, and decomposers are the most commonly studied functional groups, while Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera are the most studied taxa. Experimental studies are relatively scarce and they mainly focus on biological control, pollination, and decomposition performed in agroecosystems. These results suggest that our current knowledge on the ES provided by insects is relatively scarce and biased, and show gaps in the least-studied functional and taxonomic groups. An ambitious research agenda to improve the empirical and experimental evidence of the role played by insects in ES provision is essential to fully assess synergies between functional ecology, community ecology, and biodiversity conservation under current global changes.

	abstract = {Functional traits and functional diversity measures are increasingly being used to examine land use effects on biodiversity and community assembly rules. Morphological traits are often used directly as functional traits. However, behavioral characteristics are more difficult to measure. Establishing methods to derive behavioral traits from morphological measurements is necessary to facilitate their inclusion in functional diversity analyses. We collected morphometric data from over 1,700 individuals of 12 species of dung beetle to establish whether morphological measurements can be used as predictors of behavioral traits. We also compared morphology among individuals collected from different land uses (primary forest, logged forest, and oil palm plantation) to identify whether intraspecific differences in morphology vary among land use types. We show that leg and eye measurements can be used to predict dung beetle nesting behavior and period of activity and we used this information to confirm the previously unresolved nesting behavior for Synapsis ritsemae. We found intraspecific differences in morphological traits across different land use types. Phenotypic plasticity was found for traits associated with dispersal (wing aspect ratio and wing loading) and reproductive capacity (abdomen size). The ability to predict behavioral functional traits from morphology is useful where the behavior of individuals cannot be directly observed, especially in tropical environments where the ecology of many species is poorly understood. In addition, we provide evidence that land use change can cause phenotypic plasticity in tropical dung beetle species. Our results reinforce recent calls for intraspecific variation in traits to receive more attention within community ecology.},

	doi = {10.1111/brv.12343},
	abstract = {We synthesize findings from one of the world's largest and longest-running experimental investigations, the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP). Spanning an area of similar to 1000 km(2) in central Amazonia, the BDFFP was initially designed to evaluate the effects of fragment area on rainforest biodiversity and ecological processes. However, over its 38-year history to date the project has far transcended its original mission, and now focuses more broadly on landscape dynamics, forest regeneration, regional- and global-change phenomena, and their potential interactions and implications for Amazonian forest conservation. The project has yielded a wealth of insights into the ecological and environmental changes in fragmented forests. For instance, many rainforest species are naturally rare and hence are either missing entirely from many fragments or so sparsely represented as to have little chance of long-term survival. Additionally, edge effects are a prominent driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage and a diversity of fauna. Even within our controlled study area, the landscape has been highly dynamic: for example, the matrix of vegetation surrounding fragments has changed markedly over time, succeeding from large cattle pastures or forest clearcuts to secondary regrowth forest. This, in turn, has influenced the dynamics of plant and animal communities and their trajectories of change over time. In general, fauna and flora have responded differently to fragmentation: the most locally extinction-prone animal species are those that have both large area requirements and low tolerance of the modified habitats surrounding fragments, whereas the most vulnerable plants are those that respond poorly to edge effects or chronic forest disturbances, and that rely on vulnerable animals for seed dispersal or pollination. Relative to intact forests, most fragments are hyperdynamic, with unstable or fluctuating populations of species in response to a variety of external vicissitudes. Rare weather events such as droughts, windstorms and floods have had strong impacts on fragments and left lasting legacies of change. Both forest fragments and the intact forests in our study area appear to be influenced by larger-scale environmental drivers operating at regional or global scales. These drivers are apparently increasing forest productivity and have led to concerted, widespread increases in forest dynamics and plant growth, shifts in tree-community composition, and increases in liana (woody vine) abundance. Such large-scale drivers are likely to interact synergistically with habitat fragmentation, exacerbating its effects for some species and ecological phenomena. Hence, the impacts of fragmentation on Amazonian biodiversity and ecosystem processes appear to be a consequence not only of local site features but also of broader changes occurring at landscape, regional and even global scales.},

	abstract = {Despite its negative impacts on the environment and biodiversity, tree plantations can contribute to biodiversity conservation in fragmented landscapes, as they harbor many native species. In this study, we investigated the impact of Eucalyptus plantations on the taxonomic and functional diversity of ant communities, comparing ant communities sampled in managed and unmanaged (abandoned for 28 years) Eucalyptus plantations, and native Atlantic rain forests. Eucalyptus plantations, both managed and unmanaged, reduced the functional diversity and increased the similarity between ant communities leading to functional homogenization. While communities in managed plantations had the lowest values of both taxonomic and functional ant diversities, ant communities from unmanaged plantations had similar values of species richness, functional redundancy and Rao's Q compared to ant communities from forest patches (although functional richness was lower). In addition, communities in unmanaged Eucalyptus plantations were taxonomically and functionally more similar to communities located in managed plantations, indicating that Eucalyptus plantations have a severe long-term impact on ant communities. These results indicate that natural regeneration may mitigate the impact of Eucalyptus management, particularly regarding the functional structure of the community (a diversity), although it does not attenuate the effects of long term homogenization in community composition (beta diversity).},

	abstract = {Many contemporary landscapes have vast areas of production land-uses within landscape mosaics, which may impact species dispersal and occurrence. Here, we determined the extent to which commercial exotic plantation forests affect arthropod diversity associated with natural Afrotemperate forests in the southern Cape Afrotemperate landscape mosaic, South Africa. Natural forests and fynbos vegetation naturally coexist here, with the addition of exotic plantation forests to form a heterogeneous landscape. Epigaeic arthropods were collected by means of pitfall trapping at stations along transects from inside natural Afrotemperate forest, across the edge and into the surrounding land use, which included natural fynbos vegetation, mature forestry plantation blocks (Pinus radiata) and areas where plantations have been clear-felled. Stations were set at 5, 10, 20, 30 and 50 m to both sides of the forest edge with the addition of 100 m stations situated in the natural forest. Arthropod assemblages were distinct in all land-use types. Natural edge effect between forest and fynbos, as measured by arthropod compositional changes, was 20 m into natural forests, yet when bordered by plantations this edge increased up to 30 m into the forest. Once plantations were clear-felled, edge effects increased up to 50 m into natural forests. Responses in terms of assemblage composition and species richness were however taxon specific. Results show that (1) pine plantations are not alternative habitat for native Afrotemperate forest arthropods, (2) there were stark changes in arthropod assemblage composition at edges between these land-use types and (3) that the effects of timber plantation practices (re: clear-felling) also penetrate deep into surrounding natural forests and need to be considered in regional landscape planning. The need for an effective rehabilitation strategy of clear-felled areas is identified as key priority for bordering natural forests. Ongoing monitoring in both the disturbed area and the adjoining natural forest should be undertaken to ensure sufficient recovery.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that ecological restoration hardly recovers diversity and ecosystem function of important bioindicator groups such as dung beetles, which have key functional roles in natural and managed ecosystems. Here, we evaluated dung beetle diversity and ecological function in a restored area in a tropical rainforest landscape that comprises 10-year old cattle exclusions that include plantings of local trees and unplanted exclusions that resemble natural succession. As control habitats, we used neighbor pastures and sites in the nearest conserved forest. We found that the restored area did not improve dung beetle abundance and diversity compared to the forest, and did not differ from pastures. On the other hand, dung removal, a key ecosystem function, was similar in the forest and the restored area, but was not carried out by dung beetles in the restored area. Our study supports previous evidence showing that restoration efforts are hardly helping to recover dung beetle diversity despite they can eventually favor the recovery of function. Our results highlight the importance of considering landscape context in restoration programs, including alternative conservation strategies, such as maintenance of forest patches and restoration of connectivity between fragments to maintain dung beetle diversity and function.},

	abstract = {Environmental disturbance generates changes in local abiotic and biotic conditions, which affect the physiological condition of the organisms. However, most of the studies dealing with environmental disturbance have focused only on species diversity, and often ignore the species' health to evaluate habitat quality. Recently, through tools that evaluate the body condition of individuals, some studies have demonstrated that it is possible to know how species respond to environmental changes. In this study, we evaluated the effect of local and landscape parameters on different indicators of body condition and abundance of three dung beetle species in a fragmented Tropical rainforest in Mexico. We measured beetle's body size and three indicators of physiological condition (body dry mass, lipid and muscle mass) in 15 sites with different vegetation configuration. In general, abundance, body size and physiological condition of all species were sensitive to different landscape features. Onthophagus rhinolophus, a species typically found in conserved forest, unexpectedly showed a positive relation of body condition with landscape diversity and amount of edge, and the presence of altered sites remnants favored its body dry mass, muscle mass and body size. Nevertheless, Onthophagus batesi and Canthon cyanellus, mostly found in disturbed areas, exhibited better body condition when there were conserved habitats nearby. Therefore, we showed that O. rhinolophus is a sensitive species supporting reduced levels of habitat disturbance, while O. batesi and C. cyanellus are tolerant species that need conserved forests nearby. We highlight the importance of understanding the effect of environmental disturbance on the species' body condition in order to maintain not only abundant, but also healthy populations of wild animals in fragmented forests.},

	abstract = {The neotropical agroecosystems are important areas in the global scene in terms of livestock production. Therefore, a good conservation of their soils is crucial in order to both guarantee food safety and reduce the impact of land degradation processes. Conservation of neotropical soils used for farming activities could be obtained using veterinary medicine and adopting new grazing systems in the last decades. A wide bibliographical review was carried out which illustrates current issues in neotropical agroecosystems, the importance of their soil properties highlighting the role played by dung beetles within the edaphofauna, and the effects of the most common anti-parasitic practices as well as some natural alternatives. Finally, we present commonly adopted grazing systems and how they are affecting soil properties and animal welfare. The conversion of forest into agricultural and pasture land is altering the biochemical quality of soils. Furthermore, the use of ivermectin is dangerously reducing the total amount of dung beetles that are a key element in nutrient recycling processes. The implementation of new grazing systems (e.g., Voisin, Savory) is progressively fragmenting the habitat of many species. Nevertheless, there are also some benefits in this kind of practices and some natural alternatives to anthelmintics are being tested.},

	abstract = {Species from natural communities show different capacities for moving across contrasting habitats, and they may gradually respond along the transition between forests and anthropogenic areas. Because beetles are effective bioindicators, we analyzed the Coleoptera assemblage structure in the transition between sugarcane matrices and forest fragment. The study was conducted in an Atlantic rainforest fragment and sugarcane matrices after 2 and 6months of replantation. Beetles were sampled in linear transects that were 50, 100, and 200m from the forest edge and toward both forest core and matrices. We analyzed beetle abundance, species richness and composition, and diversity numbers. The abundance and species richness were higher in the forest, and species richness was higher at the sampling site 100m inside the forest than at the gradients within the sugarcane matrices. The species composition differed between the forest and matrices, but not between the matrices with different replantation ages. Alpha diversity based on the number of species was higher in the forest, and alpha diversity based on the Shannon index was higher in the forest and matrix after 6months of replantation. Our results suggest that the sugarcane matrices, chiefly the matrix after 2months of replantation, sustain an impoverished beetle assemblage when compared with the forest fragment. Despite the strong habitat distinction, the beetle fauna in the sugarcane matrices was not affected by the horizontal distance from the forest. Here, we have highlighted the importance of forest fragments embedded in harsh matrices for the maintenance of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {At the global scale, species diversity is known to strongly increase towards the equator for most taxa. According to theory, a higher resource specificity of consumers facilitates the coexistence of a larger number of species and has been suggested as an explanation for the latitudinal diversity gradient. However, only few studies support the predicted increase in specialisation or even showed opposite results. Surprisingly, analyses for detritivores are still missing. Therefore, we performed an analysis on the degree of trophic specialisation of dung beetles. We summarised 45 studies, covering the resource preferences of a total of 994503 individuals, to calculate the dung specificity in each study region. Our results highlighted a significant (4.3-fold) increase in the diversity of beetles attracted to vertebrate dung towards the equator. However, their resource specificity was low, unrelated to diversity and revealed a highly generalistic use of dung resources that remained similar along the latitudinal gradient.},

	doi = {10.1002/ecs2.2491},
	abstract = {Loss of large-bodied mammals across the globe through hunting, habitat degradation, and fragmentation is one of the most significant anthropogenic impacts on the environment. Cascading effects of these extinctions through ecosystems have been little studied, although correlative studies have revealed co-extinctions in closely linked groups, with implications for ecosystem structure and function. Despite playing important roles in seed dispersal and hence seedling recruitment, mammals have been largely neglected in network studies. Similarly, the role of secondary seed dispersers, such as ants and dung beetles, has been largely unexplored. Most dung beetles rely on mammal feces for feeding and breeding and provide a suite of important ecosystem functions and services. While dung beetle community responses to environmental change have been widely investigated, studies quantifying the network of associations between dung beetle and mammal species are lacking. By developing the first quantitative mammal-dung beetle networks, we address several important knowledge gaps contributing to the understanding of how interactions in networks involving mammals and secondary insect seed dispersers are structured. We use the resulting quantitative interaction networks to model mammal species extinction scenarios to further explore the consequences for dung beetle populations, and the extent to which networks change the strength of interactions through resource switching. Dung beetle feeding and breeding networks did not differ significantly in structure and showed high nestedness and low levels of trophic specialization. Simulations suggested that mammal extinction scenarios based on mammal body mass and mammal dung volume will impact dung beetle populations to a greater extent than random scenarios of mammal loss. Thus, despite their generalist feeding preferences, realistic mammal extinction scenarios have the potential to negatively impact the dung beetle community, which may have consequences for ecosystem functioning.},

	doi = {10.1111/ddi.12785},
	abstract = {Aim: We aimed to test whether contributions of individual species (SCBD) and contributions of single sites (LCBD) to overall beta diversity can be predicted by species metrics and species characteristics and also by community metrics and ecological variables, respectively. Location: A mainland-island landscape in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest domain. Methods: Dung beetles were sampled along 100 sampling units within four large forest fragments. We partitioned beta diversity into SCBD and LCBD aiming to explore their relationships to species and site characteristics, respectively. We then used a combination of multivariate methods and beta regression analyses to examine patterns in SCBD and LCBD. The occupancy, total abundance, niche position, niche breadth and biological traits of species were used as predictor variables for SCBD values. Community metrics, environmental and spatial variables, and temporal patterns in the beta diversity components of turnover and nestedness were used as predictor variables for LCDB values. Results: We found that SCBD was strongly related to various species characteristics, such as occupancy, abundance and niche position, but was not related to biological traits of species and niche breadth. In particular, occupancy and its quadratic term showed a very strong unimodal relationship with SCBD, suggesting that intermediate species in terms of site occupancy contribute most to beta diversity. LCBD was mostly explained by variation in species richness, with a negative relationship being detected. Litter height and large-scale spatial variables were also important in explaining variation in LCBD. Main conclusions: SCBD and LCBD were highly predictably related to species occupancy and species richness, respectively. Environmental conditions and large-scale spatial variables also correlated with LCBD values. Understanding the determinants of SCBD and LCBD may thus hold a key to various general ecological, bioassessment and conservation issues. Protecting sites with high LCBD values may be a suitable approach to practical biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {Edge effects alter insect biodiversity in several ways. However, we still have a limited understanding on simultaneous responses of ecological populations and assemblages to ecotones, especially in human modified landscapes. We analyze edge effects on dung beetle populations and assemblages between livestock pastures and native temperate forests (Juniperus and pine-oak forests (POFs)) to describe how species abundances and assemblage parameters respond to edge effects through gradients in forest-pasture ecotones. In Juniperus forest 13 species avoided the ecotones: six species showed greater abundance in forest interior and seven in pasturelands, while the other two species had a neutral response to the edge. In a different way, in POF we found five species avoiding the edge (four with greater abundance in pastures and only one in forest), two species had a neutral response, and two showed a unimodal pattern of abundance near to the edge. At the assemblage level edge effects are masked, as species richness, diversity, functional richness, functional evenness, and compositional incidence dissimilarity did not vary along forest-pasture ecotones. However, total abundance and functional divergence showed higher values in pastures in one of the two sampling localities. Also, assemblage similarity based on species' abundance showed a peak near to the edge in POF. We propose that conservation efforts in human-managed landscapes should focus on mitigating current and delayed edge effects. Ecotone management will be crucial in livestock dominated landscapes to conserve regional biodiversity and the environmental services carried out by dung beetles.},

	abstract = {Beta diversity is often a dominant characteristic in mountain systems and naturally fragmented ecosystems. However, natural protected areas are traditionally designed to protect ecosystems with high alpha and low beta diversity. Recent information about dung beetles of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt was used to identify the most suitable strategy for the conservation of insect biodiversity in montane and beta-diverse ecosystems. Mean alpha diversity by mountain represents 38\% of regional diversity. Most of the variation in beta diversity is explained because each mountain represents a unique habitat hosting a highly differentiated community. National parks appear to be inefficient to protect the high beta diversity shown by Mexican temperate mountains, especially for insect communities adapted to fragile ecosystems. The Archipelago Reserve scheme seems to be a suitable alternative to protect montane entomofauna and beta-diverse ecosystems. Our study reveals beta diversity patterns and complementarity among sites in a montane system, representing a first step to detect a suitable region for establishing an Archipelago Reserve in the Transmexican Volcanic Belt. Nevertheless, an analysis that matches current diversity patterns and protected areas is required to establish the best configuration for future reserves.},

	abstract = {The degradation and replacement of natural ecosystems affect species abundance, diversity and interspecific interaction through the modification of resource availability and environmental conditions. Land uses preserving the forest canopy show higher species richness and similarity to the native forest. In this study, we explored changes in the trophic niche overlap of dung beetles between the native forest and different land uses in the semideciduous Atlantic forest, under the hypothesis that trophic niche overlap increases with species richness. We sampled dung beetles in protected native forests and four land uses (pine plantations, agroforestry parklands, silvo-pastoral systems and open pastures), using seven potential food sources (monkey, feline, tapir and deer dung, decomposing fruit, decomposing fungi and carrion). The species richness of each habitat, the trophic niche overlap and the relation between both measures were analysed. Also, we explored species trophic preferences in each habitat to explain and discuss the results obtained in trophic niche overlap measures. As expected, our results showed a positive relation between species richness and trophic niche overlap. Moreover, the addition of different resources in open habitats did not increase species richness, suggesting that resource availability may not be the main mechanism explaining the empoverished dung beetle community observed in open habitats. Other mechanisms, such as physiological restrictions, may play a role in limiting the use of these habitats. Studies on the mechanisms leading to the patterns of species abundance and diversity observed in land uses are necessary to propose management recommendations that increase the sustainability of open habitats.},

	abstract = {Protection of the world's remaining forests and biodiversity is a matter of global concern. Yunnan, China is home to China's only mainland tropical rainforests, and 20\% of China's total biodiversity. Despite restoration measures and establishment of new protected areas, this region is still experiencing biodiversity loss due to inadequate management and monitoring. We evaluate restoration success of China's tropical forests in Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve (XSBN-NNR), Yunnan, China using dung beetles as an indicator taxon. We sampled across a land-use gradient of human alteration: protected forest, restored forest, community owned forest, and rubber plantation. We collected 3,748 dung beetles from 21 species over a 3 month period. Multivariate analyses revealed unique assemblages in each land-use category, but with restored forest most similar to protected areas, suggesting restoration success in this region. Community forests were more diverse than plantations, suggesting that community forests may be a valuable and practical conservation tool in this region. Most species were generalists, although some had dietary and habitat preferences. Furthermore, dietary niche breadths were, on average, higher in disturbed areas, suggesting that disturbance may result in dietary changes. We show that restoration of tropical forests appears to be successful for a key ecological and biological indicator group-dung beetles. Furthermore, community-owned forests appear to be valuable and practical method of maintaining ecosystem health and biodiversity in the region. Future management in this region would likely benefit from encouragement to maintain community-owned forests, economic incentives for restoring farmland to forest, and increased environmental monitoring across the land-use gradient.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests account for 7\% of the earth's surface harboring more than 50\% of the biodiversity on Earth. Unfortunately, deforestation continues at high rates with negative consequences for biodiversity. With the decrease of natural habitats, biodiversity maintenance in areas degraded by human activity is a challenge. In order to maintain biodiversity, both in natural areas and in agro-ecosystems, knowledge of the structure and function of organism communities is important. Dung beetles (Scarabaeidae) play an important role in tropical ecosystems by recycling organic matter. Dung beetle diversity was appraised during 1 yr in an Atlantic forest remnant and five anthropic adjacent vegetation systems. In total, 1,047 individuals were sampled representing 17 species. Scybalocanthon nigriceps was the most abundant (523 individuals: 50\%) almost exclusively in forest areas. Ataenius aft platensis (48 individuals: 4.6\%), and Canthon aft luctuosus ( 109 individuals: 10.4\%) were observed in all areas, while Canthon virens chalybaeus (111 individuals: 10.6\%) was limited to anthropic areas. Dung beetle diversity was affected by microclimatic conditions concerning precipitation and air temperature. The greatest abundance and richness was found in the rainy season with a striking reduction in the dry period. The pasture sustained the lowest species diversity and abundance. However, there are clear signs that tree structure and microclimatic conditions similar to forests, as found in agroforestry, can help preserve biodiversity by creating a propitious habitat for native species. This is especially important in the forest regions of the Neotropics where dung beetles exhibit their greatest diversity. As dung beetles greatly depend on mammal feces and carrion, it is suggested that future studies incorporate the occurrence of mammals in investigations of the effects of landscape structure on scarab diversity.},

	abstract = {Subspecies is a debated taxonomic rank that, in some cases, could indicate that a speciation process is taking place. Studying the degree of co-occurrence among subspecies along environmental gradients may help to determine its taxonomic status. In this study, we explore the distribution of two subspecies of Canthon rutilans along spatio-temporal and temperature gradients in the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil in order to reinforce their current subspecies status or to support their consideration as two different species. A yearly survey conducted along an elevational transect (from 250 m to 1630 m) shows that there is no spatio-temporal overlap between the two taxa. We collected 899 individuals of Canthon rutilans cyanescens and 29 individuals of Canthon rutilans rutilans. C. rutilans cyanescens can be found at 250 m (all year except in June), 430 m (August to April), and 840 m (September to April) in elevation, and when the air temperature oscillates from 15.3 degrees C to 24.0 degrees C. C. rutilans rutilans can be found at 1360 m (October to February), 1630 m (January) in elevation, and when the air temperature oscillates from 14.4 degrees C to 18.6 degrees C. Furthermore, local temperature data taken during the survey indicates that both subspecies also have a limited overlap in their thermal response curves. All these results suggest that these two taxa could be considered as two different species with dissimilar physiological and ecological requirements probably as a consequence of temperature-mediated divergent adaptation. Further molecular data can confirm or reject this supposition in the near future.},

	abstract = {beta-diversity is key in understanding how ecological communities have been assembled across spatiotemporal scales. Separating beta-diversity into its process-related components can provide richer insights into biodiversity organization. In this study, we aimed to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of beta-diversity components in the composition and structure of dung beetle communities. Dung beetles were sampled in 20 Atlantic Forest sites in a mainland-island scenario. We partitioned beta-diversity dissimilarity based on species composition and abundance into turnover and nestedness components, and into balanced variation in abundance and abundance gradient components respectively. The mainland had higher multiple-site values of spatial turnover and balanced variation in abundance than the island; meanwhile, nestedness-resultant dissimilarity and abundance gradients had low relative importance, although the latter values were always higher on the island. There was an increase of spatial turnover and balanced variation in abundance with spatial extent, while nestedness-resultant dissimilarity and abundance gradients were unrelated to the scale. The temporal turnover increased with increasing spatial extents and a different response pattern occurred between mainland and island. Our study provides support for how spatial extents influence both incidence-based and abundance-based beta-diversity components and shape metacommunity composition and structure in mainland-island systems.},

	abstract = {Functional diversity is commonly used to assess the conservation value of ecosystems, but we have not yet established whether functional and taxonomic approaches are interchangeable or complementary to evaluate community dynamics over time and in response to disturbances. We used a five-year dataset of dung beetles from undisturbed forest, primary forest corridors, and Eucalyptus plantations to compare the sensitivity of conceptually equivalent metrics to temporal variation in different anthropogenic disturbances. We compared species richness with functional richness, Pielou's evenness with functional evenness, and Simpson's diversity with Rao's quadratic entropy. We assessed the sensitivity of the metrics to anthropogenic changes. The indices showed complex patterns among habitat types, with with similar responses in some cases and not in other, and little incongruence between the pairs within the same year. The influence of disturbance on longer-term temporal variation over the five-year period revealed lower temporal variation in functional than taxonomic metrics. Both approaches showed greater variation in plantations compared to native forests. We evaluated the variation in taxonomic and functional metrics between consecutive years and among habitats. Most metrics showed similar shifts between years in all habitats, except for species and functional richness. We demonstrate that even conceptually similar indices may not provide similar information on dung beetles responses to disturbance. However, the differences between the indices can yield key insights about the drivers of change, especially over the long-term. It is important to use taxonomic and functional diversity in tandem to better understand community responses to environmental and anthropogenic changes.},

	abstract = {The Brazilian Cerrado harbors great floristic and structural diversity composed of a mosaic of natural vegetation types and anthropogenic environments such as introduced pastures. Here, our goal was to evaluate the patterns of taxonomic and functional diversity of dung beetles in a human-modified landscape in Brazilian Cerrado. For this, we evaluated the species richness, species composition and abundance (non-weighted by abundance) and species diversity (Shannon indexweighted by abundance) and three functional indexes (functional richness, functional evenness and functional dispersion). We collected the insects in fragments of Cerrado (Cerrado stricto sensu), riparian forests under pressure of timber removal and livestock and exotic pastures (Urochloa spp.) in Anastacio and Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. We used pitfall traps baited with human feces and fresh capybara dung, a large native rodent, as a representative of the mammal regional fauna. Dung beetle richness was higher in Cerrado fragments, while the abundance was higher in exotic pastures and riparian forests. Species composition differed among vegetation types. Finally, the species diversity and functional diversity did not differ among vegetation types. Thus, we demonstrated the information generated by conceptually similar indexes (e.g. functional richness, species richness and species diversity) may not provide similar information on dung beetles responses to disturbance due to differences in the weighting on species abundance. Finally, the use of taxonomic and functional metrics generate complementary information that can helps us to reach more efficient conclusions in terms of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem functionality in human-modified variegated landscape.},

	abstract = {Aim In several ecosystems, the diversity of functional species traits has been shown to have a stronger effect on ecosystem functioning than taxonomic diversity alone. However, few studies have explored this idea at a large geographical scale. In a multisite experiment, we unravelled the relationship between ecosystem function and functional completeness of species assemblages using dung beetles as a model group, focusing on dung removal and secondary seed dispersal. Location Seventeen grassland locations across the Western Palaearctic. Methods We used a randomized block design with different exclosure types to control the dung and seed removing activities of individual functional groups of the local dung beetle assemblage. We classified dung beetle species according to resource specialization and into functional groups based on dung processing behaviour (dwellers, tunnellers, rollers) and body size (small, large). Additionally, we assessed the role of other soil macro-invertebrates. By sampling the dung beetle community and measuring the remaining dung and seeds after the experiment, the impact of each functional group was estimated. Results Dung beetle assemblages differed along a north-south and east-west gradient. Dwellers dominated northernmost sites, whereas at lower latitudes we observed more tunnellers and rollers indicating a functional shift. Resource specialists were more abundant in southern and eastern areas. Overall, functional group diversity enhanced dung removal. More dung (+46.9\%) and seeds (+32.1\%) were removed in the southern sites and tunnellers and rollers were more effective. At the northernmost sites, where tunnellers were scarce or absent, other soil macro-invertebrates removed the majority of dung. Main conclusions The conservation of functionally complete dung beetle assemblages is crucial to maintain the ecosystem functions provided by dung beetles. Given the latitudinal variation in functional group diversity, it is reasonable to expect compositional changes due to climate change. These changes could lead to increased dung removal and a higher secondary seed dispersal rate in northern regions.},

	abstract = {The beetles present great taxonomic and functional diversity; however, in the Northeast region of Brazil, especially in the semiarid Caatinga region, the knowledge on the Coleoptera fauna is very restricted. Because the Caatinga presents different landscapes, it is important to survey the coleopterofauna in the different phytophysiognomies, seeking to encompass a spatial variability found in this xeric region. Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform a survey of beetles in the semiarid region of Paraiba state, Northeast Brazil. We collected weekly during four years (2009-2013) using Malaise traps in two phytophysiognomies, an area with xerophytic vegetation and another with riparian forest. A total of 6,567 individuals belonging to 383 species and 42 families of Coleoptera were sampled. Chrysomelidae (78 spp.), Curculionidae (57 spp.), and Cerambycidae (28 spp.) had a higher richness, while Chrysomelidae (30.4\% of individuals), Curculionidae (8.3\%), and Tenebrionidae (7.7\%) were the most abundant. A large number of singletons and doubletons were collected despite the long sampling period, indicating that there must be much more species to be recorded. Our results demonstrate a rich fauna of beetles in the studied region. We provide a list of occurring beetles with new records of species for the Paraiba state and thus contribute to the knowledge of the diversity of the Coleoptera in the Northeast Brazil.},

Edaphic beetles comprise several families that are considered effective bioindicators. In this study, we analyzed how environmental parameters and fragment size affect edaphic beetle assemblage in a fragmented rainforest landscape in Brazil. Beetles were sampled in 12 forest fragments using pitfall traps. Fragment size, tree density and diameter, litter depth and dry weight, and canopy cover were measured in each forest fragment. Staphylinidae and Carabidae were the beetle families with the highest species richness, whereas Scarabaeidae and Nitidulidae were the most abundant families. Beetle abundance was positively affected by litter dry weight and fragment size. In addition, species composition was significantly affected by fragment area. In conclusion, forest patch size is an important parameter for maintaining edaphic beetle assemblages in tropical rainforests, causing major shifts in its abundance and species distribution.},

	abstract = {Naturally fragmented landscapes provide suitable scenarios through which to investigate patch and landscape effects on biodiversity patterns in areas that are isolated from the disturbances usually associated with human made fragments. We aimed to investigate the patch and landscape effects on the diversity of forest-dependent and matrix-tolerant dung beetles in a naturally fragmented landscape. We also assessed the influence that seasonal and vegetation variations had on these dung beetles. We sampled dung beetles during two summers and two winters in 14 forest islands of various sizes and shapes within a natural mountainous forest archipelago in southeast Brazil. We measured the patch and landscape variables based on high-resolution multispectral images of circular sectors with radii of 100, 250, and 500 m. We used generalized linear mixed models to relate dung beetle metrics to patch and landscape attributes. The interaction between canopy cover and season influenced both species' richness and abundance of the dung beetle metacommunity. The forest-dependent species' richness increased with greater canopy cover, regardless of the season. Patch attributes (e.g., size, canopy cover, distance to the closest patch, and distance to continuous forest) and landscape attributes (e.g., percentage of forest in the landscape, total edge, number of patches, distance to the nearest neighbor, and shape complexity) had small general effects on dung beetle species as a whole and on matrix-tolerant species in particular. However, these values strongly influenced forest-dependent species' richness, abundance, and temporal beta diversity. The matrix-tolerant species, therefore, mask the effects of patch and landscape effects on forest-dependent species within the mountainous forest archipelago. In other words, the changes in these patch and landscape attributes influenced forest-dependent and matrix-tolerant species differently. Therefore, the evaluation of entire metacommunities may not be helpful when evaluating species-specific responses in mixed landscapes-a fact that impairs the conservation of forest-dependent species.

	abstract = {Dung beetles are increasingly used as a study taxon-both as bioindicators of environmental change, and as a model system for exploring ecosystem functioning. The advantages of this focal taxon approach are many; dung beetles are abundant in a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems, speciose, straightforward to sample, respond to environmental gradients and can be easily manipulated to explore species-functioning relationships. However, there remain large gaps in our understanding of the relationship between dung beetles and the mammals they rely on for dung. Here we review the literature, showing that despite an increase in the study of dung beetles linked to ecosystem functioning and to habitat and land use change, there has been little research into their associations with mammals. We summarize the methods and findings from dung beetle-mammal association studies to date, revealing that although empirical field studies of dung beetles rarely include mammal data, those that do, indicate mammal species presence and composition has a large impact on dung beetle species richness and abundance. We then review the methods used to carry out diet preference and ecosystem functioning studies, finding that despite the assumption that dung beetles are generalist feeders, there are few quantitative studies that directly address this. Together this suggests that conclusions about the effects of habitat change on dung beetles are based on incomplete knowledge. We provide recommendations for future work to identify the importance of considering mammal data for dung beetle distributions, composition and their contributions to ecosystem functioning; a critical step if dung beetles are to be used as a reliable bioindicator taxon.},

Yet, these landscape factors are often confounded, leaving much to be investigated about their relative effects, especially on species interactions. In a landscape experiment, we investigated the consequences of connectivity and edge effects for seed dispersal by ants. We found that ants dispersed seeds farther in habitat patches connected by corridors, but only in patch centers. We did not see an effect on the total number of seeds moved or the rate ants detected seeds. Furthermore, we did not see any differences in ant community composition across patch types, suggesting that shifts in ant behavior or other factors increased ant seed dispersal in patches connected by corridors. Long-distance seed dispersal by ants that requires an accumulation of short-distance dispersal events over generations may be an underappreciated mechanism through which corridors increase plant diversity.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss is a primary threat to biodiversity across the planet, yet contentious debate has ensued on the importance of habitat fragmentation ‘per se’ (i.e., altered spatial conﬁguration of habitat for a given amount of habitat loss). Based on a review of landscape-scale investigations, Fahrig (2017; Ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 48:1-23) reports that biodiversity responses to habitat fragmentation ‘per se’ are more often positive rather than negative and concludes that the widespread belief in negative fragmentation eﬀects is a ‘zombie idea’. We show that Fahrig's conclusions are drawn from a narrow and potentially biased subset of available evidence, which ignore much of the observational, experimental and theoretical evidence for negative eﬀects of altered habitat conﬁguration. We therefore argue that Fahrig's conclusions should be interpreted cautiously as they could be misconstrued by policy makers and managers, and we provide six arguments why they should not be applied in conservation decision-making. Reconciling the scientiﬁc disagreement, and informing conservation more eﬀectively, will require research that goes beyond statistical and correlative approaches. This includes a more prudent use of data and conceptual models that appropriately partition direct vs indirect inﬂuences of habitat loss and altered spatial conﬁguration, and more clearly discriminate the mechanisms underpinning any changes. Incorporating these issues will deliver greater mechanistic understanding and more predictive power to address the conservation issues arising from habitat loss and fragmentation.},

	abstract = {Habitat fragmentation can create significant impediments to dispersal. A technique to increase dispersal between otherwise isolated fragments is the use of corridors. Although previous studies have compared dispersal between connected fragments to dispersal between unconnected fragments, it remains unknown how dispersal between fragments connected by a corridor compares to dispersal in unfragmented landscapes. To assess the extent to which corridors can restore dispersal in fragmented landscapes to levels observed in unfragmented landscapes, we employed a stable-­isotope marking technique to track seeds within four unfragmented landscapes and eight experimental landscapes with fragments connected by corridors. We studied two wind-­and two bird-d­ ispersed plant species, because previous community-­based research showed that dispersal mode explains how connectivity effects vary among species. We constructed dispersal kernels for these species in unfragmented landscapes and connected fragments by marking seeds in the center of each landscape with 15N and then recovering marked seeds in seed traps at distances up to 200 m. For the two wind-d­ispersed plants, seed dispersal kernels were similar in ­unfragmented landscapes and connected fragments. In contrast, dispersal kernels of bird-­ dispersed seeds were both affected by fragmentation and differed in the direction of the impact: Morella cerifera experienced more and Rhus copallina experienced less long-d­ istance dispersal in unfragmented than in connected landscapes. These results show that corridors can facilitate dispersal probabilities comparable to those observed in unfragmented landscapes. Although dispersal mode may provide useful broad predictions, we acknowledge that similar species may respond uniquely due to factors such as seasonality and disperser behavior. Our results further indicate that prior work has likely underestimated dispersal distances of wind-d­ispersed plants and that factors altering long-­distance dispersal may have a greater impact on the spread of species than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Livestock dung provides an important direct pathway by which carbon and nutrients enter soils in pasture ecosystems and affects carbon and nitrogen cycling indirectly through changes in soil and plant properties. Here, we quantify dung deposition, decomposition, and the effects of dung on soil and plants in a Zoysia japonica grassland in Japan. We determined (1) the distribution of dung, (2) the mass loss rate of dung and the amount of carbon respired as CO2, and (3) changes in soil properties and aboveground biomass of Z. japonica. Dung deposition was 4.0–9.7 g C and 0.4–1.0 g N m−2 year−1 and distributed patchily (Morishita's Iδ {\textgreater} 1). Most (71 \%) of the carbon in dung deposited in June was lost within a single grazing period by aerobic decomposition, more than mass loss rate of Z. japonica litter in the first year (about 50 \%), suggesting that grazing and defecation can accelerate carbon cycling compared with the typical litterfall–decomposition regime. Nitrogen in dung mass entered the soil as ammonium nitrogen and was nitrified. The spatiotemporal distribution of these processes corresponded to that of stimulated Z. japonica growth. These results suggested that dung deposition significantly affected the inorganic nitrogen status of soil and, therefore, the growth of Z. japonica. However, these effects were very restricted temporally (July–August) and spatially (within 10 cm from dung edge). Thus, such spatiotemporally restricted effects combined with the patchy distribution of dung may contribute to the heterogeneous structure of pasture ecosystems.},

Empirical studies of fragmented landscapes often reveal strong effects of fragment area and isolation on species richness, although other predictions of the theory, such as accelerated species turnover in fragments, have been tested less frequently. As predicted by IBT, biota in fragments typically ‘relax’ over time towards lower species richness. Beyond these broad generalizations, however, the relevance of IBT for understanding fragmented ecosystems is limited. First, IBT provides few predictions about how community composition in fragments should change over time, and which species should be most vulnerable. Second, edge effects can be an important driver of local species extinctions and ecosystem change, but are not considered by IBT. Third, the matrix of modified vegetation surrounding fragments—also ignored by IBT—can strongly influence fragment connectivity, which in turn affects the demography, genetics, and survival of local populations. Fourth, most fragmented landscapes are also altered by other anthropogenic changes, such as hunting, logging, fires, and pollution, which can interact synergistically with habitat fragmentation. Finally, fragmentation often has diverse impacts on ecosystem properties such as canopy-gap dynamics, carbon storage, and the trophic structure of communities that are not considered by IBT. I highlight these phenomena with findings from fragmented ecosystems around the world.},

This review study aimed to examine GT in the field of ecological network analysis based on the following questions: In what areas are the articles focused?, what indexes or graph-based indicators have been thus far utilized in ecological network analysis?, and what aspects of ecological network analysis have been less considered in terms of the use of the GT indicators? To address these questions, a systematic literature review was conducted and the results showed that most of the articles in this field had been fulfilled in China, the United States, and France. This theory could have implications for more research on plants and mammals. In addition, 118 indicators were identified in the field of GT in the ecological network analysis. Among these indicators, the probability of connectivity (PC) and an integral index of connectivity (IIC) had been consistently exploited in most articles. Moreover, the results revealed the increasing trend of introducing the new indicators of GT to ecological network analysis, suggesting the applicability of GT in this context. Despite the importance of ecological network resilience, it has been less reflected from the GT perspective while it can be useful and efficient in analyzing the sustainability of ecological networks within this framework. The current trend of exploiting the GT indicators delineates three future lines of development, viz. (1) the GT use more widely in ecological network analysis, (2) emerging new and more precise indexes, and (3) new concerns mainly examining ecological network resilience.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the spatial decision-making of loggers and implications for forest fragmentation in the Amazon basin. It provides a behavioral explanation for fragmentation by modeling how loggers build road networks, typically abandoned upon removal of hardwoods. Logging road networks provide access to land, and the settlers who take advantage of them clear fields and pastures that accentuate their spatial signatures. In shaping agricultural activities, these networks organize emergent patterns of forest fragmentation, even though the loggers move elsewhere. The goal of the article is to explicate how loggers shape their road networks, in order to theoretically explain an important type of forest fragmentation found in the Amazon basin, particularly in Brazil. This is accomplished by adapting graph theory to represent the spatial decision-making of loggers, and by implementing computational algorithms that build graphs interpretable as logging road networks. The economic behavior of loggers is conceptualized as a profit maximization problem, and translated into spatial decision-making by establishing a formal correspondence between mathematical graphs and road networks. New computational approaches, adapted from operations research, are used to construct graphs and simulate spatial decision-making as a function of discount rates, land tenure, and topographic constraints. The algorithms employed bracket a range of behavioral settings appropriate for areas of terras devolutas, public lands that have not been set aside for environmental protection, indigenous peoples, or colonization. The simulation target sites are located in or near so-called Terra do Meio, once a major logging frontier in the lower Amazon Basin. Simulation networks are compared to empirical ones identified by remote sensing and then used to draw inferences about factors influencing the spatial behavior of loggers. Results overall suggest that Amazonia's logging road networks induce more fragmentation than necessary to access fixed quantities of wood. The paper concludes by considering implications of the approach and findings for Brazil's move to a system of concession logging.},

Fragmentation of natural ecosystems leads to decline in functions and services with severe impact on people. In Ecuador, despite establishment of the nationwide ecosystem classification, this baseline information has not been fully exploited to generate a monitoring system for ecosystem changes. Forest ecosystems are altered daily in Ecuador by human impact, but the relationship between forest fragmentation and human land use has not been adequately explored. To provide an overview of how recent forest fragmentation at the national and ecosystem level was affected by practices in human land use, we quantified the degree of forest fragmentation using the forest fragmentation index (FFI). The relationship between the degree of forest ecosystem fragmentation and human land use of 64 natural forest ecosystems was analyzed during the time period 1990 to 2014. At the national level, the expansion of pasture and inhabited area significantly increased forest fragmentation. The regression models based on the FFI value indicated that the forest fragmentation was highly correlated to pastures in forest ecosystems with low, moderate, and high fragmentation in 2014 due to a progressive increase in pastures. This study showed the critical gaps between forest conservation strategies and actual practices in human land use.},

	abstract = {The functional space of an ecological community is not evenly filled by its species. Instead, it is usually divided into areas of high species density, where species with common combinations of functional traits are grouped into species rich clusters, while lower density areas are filled with species poor clusters or isolated species with uncommon or unique combinations of traits. Species whose functional traits differ from those of the rest of the community are expected to play distinct ecological roles and over-contribute to ecosystem functionality. Sampling methods used to characterize arthropod assemblages usually target subsets of the community and filter species based on their functional traits, reducing the probability of detecting species with uncommon combinations of functional traits. Consideration of these species is particularly important for characterizing the functional structure and resilience of ecological communities inhabiting threatened ecosystems such as lowland Amazonian rainforests, in which dung beetles play multiple ecological roles and are commonly used as ecological indicators. In this study, we characterize the functional structure of a diverse Amazonian dung beetle assemblage using five different sampling methods (dung- and carrion-baited pitfalls, dung-baited aerial traps, flight interception traps, and visual transects) and 18 different functional traits. Our main objective is to assess the suitability of these methods for the detection of the functional volume of the assemblage and of species with uncommon or unique combinations of functional traits that are expected to support vulnerable ecosystem functions. We found that, although dung-baited pitfalls (DPF) detected the highest species richness and proportion of the functional volume, they did not detect 30 species out of 103 and over 20\% of the functional volume of the assemblage. The additional sampling methods captured more species with uncommon combinations of functional traits than expected by chance, some of which were trophic specialists not attracted to DPFs. The use of complementary sampling methods resulted in a better characterization of the functional structure of dung beetle communities inhabiting both terra firme and floodplain Amazonian rainforests and revealed functional resilience and rare species playing ecological roles overlooked by DPFs. The consideration of these species is of great importance given the threats that tropical rainforests face worldwide.},

	abstract = {The clearing and fragmentation of terrestrial ecosystems is commonly acknowledged as a major cause of the decline of biodiversity. These and other predicted responses to habitat fragmentation are derived from theory, which ecologists have tested with empirical approaches ranging from observations to experimental manipulations. These empirical approaches have also identified areas of theory in need of additional development. For example, experimental studies of fragmentation have provided insights such as the key role played by the matrix surrounding fragments, the importance of edge effects, and the impacts of corridors linking fragments with one another. Much less clear, however, is the extent to which these theoretical and empirical studies – while advancing our conceptual understanding of ecological responses to landscape change – help guide management and conservation practice. We review lessons learned from landscape-scale fragmentation experiments and observational studies, present the results of a survey of fragmentation and conservation experts which probed for links and mismatches between fragmentation studies and conservation practice, and discuss how future studies can contribute to conservation practice. Our survey showed that respondents consider fragmentation theory and empirical studies and their findings important for guiding conservation and management practices. The survey also identified that there are disconnects between what is typically studied by fragmentation ecologists and factors that are central to the practice of biodiversity conservation, notably, community-based human dimensions (e.g. economic, social, health issues), policy and governance, ecosystem services, eco-evolutionary responses of species, and interaction of multiple threats to biodiversity and ecosystem processes. We discuss how these disconnects can present opportunities for experiments to continue to provide valuable recommendations for conservation practice in fragmented landscapes.},

	abstract = {Aim To analyse how the dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) respond to a modified, variegated landscape, taking into account the biogeographical peculiarities of the Mexican Transition Zone. Location This study covers cloud forest (CF) of the Sierra Norte de Puebla mountain range and part of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range (Mexico). Methods We applied proportional sampling based on the landscape variegation model with Scarabaeinae as the indicator group, and using two approaches: structural units (vegetation type) and spatial units (windows). We used two measures – richness and Shannon diversity – and applied multiplicative diversity partitioning to obtain independent alpha and beta diversities for the landscape, windows and vegetation types. We grouped species by biogeographical distribution pattern for the biogeographical analysis and by whether they were originally from CF. Results The transformation of CF into secondary forest, pastures and other types of vegetation increases the Scarabaeinae diversity of the landscape, in vegetation types and windows. This increase is the result of species arriving from the tropical lowlands. However, the original dung beetle community of the CF dominates at different scales in the number of species, abundance and biomass. With increasing habitat modification, beta diversity increases in the windows, and species with the Tropical Palaeoamerican distribution pattern increase in abundance in vegetation types and windows. Main conclusions The variegated character of the landscape explains well the distribution and diversity of this dung beetle community. The peculiar characteristics of the Mexican Transition Zone have an effect owing to the overlap of fauna with different biogeographical origins. The conversion of fragmented landscapes to variegated landscapes could be a conservation goal in human-modified mountain landscapes. Sampling proportional to the area of different types of vegetation and the use of windows offer an alternative experimental design in variegated landscapes.},

	abstract = {Understanding the response of species to anthropogenic landscape modification is essential to design effective conservation programs. Recently, insects have been used in empirical studies to evaluate the impact of habitat modification and landscape fragmentation on biological diversity because they are often affected rapidly by changes in land use. In this study, the use of the landscape matrix by dung and carrion beetles in a fragmented tropical rain forest in the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve was analyzed. Fragments of tropical rain forest, forest-pasture edges, pastures, isolated trees, living fences (trees connected with barbed wire) and barbed wire fences were studied both near and far from forest fragments. Forest fragments had the highest abundance values, but pastures had the highest dung and carrion beetle biomass. Habitat specificity was high for the beetles in the most dissimilar habitats. Forest fragments and forest-pasture edges had and shared the highest number of species, but they shared only two species with pastures, barbed wire fences and isolated trees. Only one forest species was found within living fences far from the forest fragments. However, approximately 37\% of the forest species were caught within living fences near the forest fragments. Therefore, forest-pasture edges function as hard edges and prevent movement among forest fragments, but living fences seem to act as continuous habitat corridors when connected to forest fragments, allowing forest beetles to move between the fragments. Further studies are necessary to determine the minimum width of living fences necessary to provide good corridors for these beetles and other species.},

	abstract = {Although dung beetles are known to perform a multitude of ecosystem services, their effects on water infiltration, runoff, porosity, moisture and erosion of soil have never been thoroughly researched. Maintenance of these hydrological properties is important in agro-ecosystem functioning where overgrazing results in negative impacts on the soil. The study site was located in the Potshini catchment in Kwazulu-Natal (South Africa), an area heavily grazed by livestock. We conducted two rainfall simulations on three 1m−2 control (no dung) and six dung-treated plots in December 2008, and repeated the study in June 2009 on the same plots. Natural populations of dung beetles were allowed to colonise the dung. Simulations were conducted for 30min at an intensity of 30mmh−1. Key variables calculated were pre-runoff amounts (Pi), infiltration ratios (Ki), and soil losses. Samples were collected for bulk density determination during the same time periods in order to measure differences in porosity and moisture in control and dung-treated plots at different depths. Using multivariate statistics we found significant differences between dung-treated and control plots in three of four simulations. After 48h of beetle activity, Pi and Ki values were significantly increased and remained at elevated levels six months later. Soil losses were initially higher in dung-treated plots than controls, but had declined to less than control values after six months. Bulk density in the A-horizon (0–10cm) was significantly reduced after 48h of beetle activity and remained so for six months. No difference in bulk density was observed at greater depths. Soil moisture initially increased significantly in the A-horizon, as well as at 20 and 30cm depths after six months of activity. We conclude that dung beetles positively influence hydrological properties of the soil by increasing water infiltration and soil porosity, and reducing surface water runoff. Contrasting effects on soil losses are problematic to reconcile from this study. High losses initially observed may be offset in the long-term by reductions associated with the increased infiltration ratios, though this remains to be confirmed.},

	abstract = {Top-down control has been extensively documented in food webs based on living plants, where predator limitation of herbivores can cascade to facilitate plant growth (the green-world hypothesis), particularly in grasslands and aquatic systems. Yet the ecosystem role of predators in detrital food webs is less explored, as is the potential effect of climate warming on detritus-based communities. We here show that predators have a ‘‘brown-world’’ role in decomposer communities via a cascading top-down control on plant growth, based on the results of an experiment that factorially manipulated presence and size of two predator species as well as temperature (warmed vs. unwarmed). The inclusion of predatory beetles signiﬁcantly decreased abundance of coprophagous beetles and thus the rate of dung decomposition and productivity of plants growing surrounding the dung. Moreover, the magnitude of these decreases differed between predator species and, for dung loss, was temperature dependent. At ambient temperature, the larger predators tended to more strongly inﬂuence the dung loss rate than did the smaller predators; when both predators were present, the dung loss rate was higher relative to the treatments with the smaller predators but comparable to those with the larger ones, suggesting an antagonistic effect of predator interaction. However, warming substantially reduced dung decomposition rates and eliminated the effects of predation on dung decomposition. Although warming substantially decreased dung loss rates, warming only modestly reduced primary productivity. Consistent with these results, a second experiment exploring the inﬂuence of the two predator species and warming on dung loss over time revealed that predatory beetles signiﬁcantly decreased the abundance of coprophagous beetles, which was positively correlated with dung loss rates. Moreover, experimental warming decreased the water content of dung and hence the survival of coprophagous beetles. These results conﬁrm that the ‘‘brown-world’’ effect of predator beetles was due to cascading top-down control through coprophagous beetles to nutrient cycling and primary productivity. Our results also highlight potentially counterintuitive effects of climate warming. For example, global warming might signiﬁcantly decrease animalmediated decomposition of organic matter and recycling of nutrients in a future warmed world.},

Burial by dung beetles as an incidental result of their feeding and nesting activities often provides these seeds with rehgia from attack. To examine the effect of habitat disturbance on the dung beetle communities involved in this process, I surveyed dung beetles at three sites in the Amazon basin, in the states of Par\& Amazonas, and Ronddnia, Brazil. Through principal component analysis on measurementsof size and behavioral characters of beetles, I determined the relative quality of beetle species as seed dispersers (dispersal defined as horizontal or vertical movement of seeds) and ranked them into seed dispersal guilds. I used correspondenceanalysis to examine in what habitats (priiary forest or varying degrees of disturbed habitat) these guilds were abundant. Most guilds decreased with increasing habitat disturbance, but one g d d made up of large nocturnal burrowers (primarilyDichotomius) became more abundant with increasing disturbance (up to the level of highest disturbance surveyed), at which point all dung beetle species became scarce. Clear-cuts had lower species richness, lower abundance, and lower biomass than forested areas. These results imply that dear-cutting is detrimental to all seed dispersal dynamics in tropical rain forests, but that some levels of disturbance allow enough disperser activity to preserve this ecosystem function.},

Here, we present results from a standardized sampling protocol used to compare dung beetle communities across five neotropical forests in Brazil and Ecuador and two warm, north temperate forests in Mississippi and Louisiana. Species richness in the tropical forests was three to seven times higher than the temperate forests, as would be expected by studies of other taxa across tropical and temperate latitudes. Average body size in the temperate forests was larger than the tropical forests, as predicted by Bergmann’s rule. Dung beetle abundance and volume per trap-day were generally higher in Ecuador than Brazil, and higher in Mississippi than Louisiana, but there were no tropical-temperate differences. Species rank-abundance curves were similar within countries and between countries. Rank-volume distributions indicated a smaller range of beetle body sizes in Ecuador versus Brazil or the USA. Community similarity was high within countries and low between countries. Community differences between Brazil and Ecuador sites may be explained by differences in productivity based on geological age of the soils.},

I conducted ﬁeld experiments to compare seedling emergence between dung exposed to dung beetles and intact dung using both dung pellets and pats during a typical rainy month (June) and the hottest, drier month (August), when large numbers of seeds of the dominant species were present in the dung. The exposed dung was immediately attacked and broken up by dung beetles, whereas dung protected from the beetles remained intact. In June, at least 12 herbaceous species, including Z. japonica, H. maritima, Mazus pumilus, and Plantago asiatica, emerged from the dung, versus at least six species in August. Decomposition rates of the pellets in June and decomposition scores of the pats in June and August were positively correlated with the number of emerging seedlings, suggesting that the acceleration of decomposition by dung beetles can positively aﬀect seed germination. In this system of interactions among sika deer, herbaceous plants, and dung beetles, sika deer dung prevented seeds from germinating, and beetles had an indirect positive eﬀect on seedling emergence by accelerating decomposition of the dung, although the extent of the eﬀect may depend on the dung type, plant species, and environmental factors.},

              1. Habitat loss and fragmentation is a leading cause of species extinction. This not only concerns loss of major habitats, but also loss of microclimatic heterogeneity within such habitats.
            
            
              2. In this study, we examine the effects of microclimate on the abundance and movements of
              Onthophagus gibbulus
              , a dung beetle associated with pastoral habitats. While formerly widespread in Southern Finland, the species is now critically endangered at a national level, persisting within an area of 6 km
              2
              .
            
            
              3. We divided the Finnish distribution of
              O. gibbulus
              into 50 × 50‐m grid cells, characterised local microclimate by incident solar radiation, and surveyed the distribution of
              O. gibbulus
              within a subset of cells. To investigate the impact of microclimatic conditions on dung beetle movements, we conducted a mark–release–recapture study.
            
            
              4. Our approach allowed us to estimate the national population size of
              O. gibbulus
              – a figure rarely available for endangered insect species. The Finnish population of
              O. gibbulus
              comprises between 2000 and 6000 individuals.
            
            5. The abundance of beetles per dung pat increases with incident solar radiation, and beetles are more likely to move towards warmer than colder spots in the landscape.
            
              6. Overall, our study depicts
              O. gibbulus
              as a thermophile confined to the warmest part of the landscape, and offers loss of microclimatic variation as the cause for its large‐scale decline. To conserve
              O. gibbulus
              and similar species, we need to consider not only the amount of macrohabitats, but also the amount and distribution of microclimatic variation within them. Future predictions are complicated by ongoing climate change.},

	abstract = {Species richness is an important characteristic of ecological communities, but it is difﬁcult to quantify. We report here a thorough inventory of a tropical rain forest ant fauna and use it to evaluate species richness estimators. The study was carried out in ϳ1500 ha of lowland rain forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Diverse methods were used, including canopy fogging, Malaise traps, Berlese samples, Winkler samples, baiting, and manual search. Workers of 437 ant species were encountered. The abundance distribution was clearly lognormal, and the distribution emerged from a veil line with each doubling of sampling effort. Three richness estimates were calculated: the area under the ﬁtted lognormal distribution, the asymptote of the Michaelis-Menten equation ﬁt to the species accumulation curve, and the Incidence-based Coverage Estimator (ICE). The performance of the estimators was evaluated with sample-based rarefaction plots. The inventory was nearly complete because the species accumulation curve approached an asymptote, the richness estimates were very close to the observed species richness, and the uniques and duplicates curves were both declining. None of the richness estimators was stable in samplebased rarefaction plots, but regions of stability of estimators occurred. The explanation of rarity is one key to understanding why richness estimates fail. Fifty-one species (12\% of the total) were still uniques (known from only one sample) at the end of the inventory. The rarity of 20 of these species was explained by ‘‘edge effects’’: ‘‘methodological edge species’’ (possibly abundant at the site but difﬁcult to sample because of their microhabitat), and ‘‘geographic edge species,’’ known to be common in habitats or regions outside of La Selva. Rarity of 31 species remained unexplained. Most of the 51 rare species were known from additional collections outside of La Selva, either in other parts of Costa Rica or in other countries. Only six species were ‘‘global uniques,’’ known to date from only one sample on Earth. The study demonstrates that patterns of species occurrence early in an inventory may be inadequate to estimate species richness, but that relatively complete inventories of species-rich arthropod communities are possible if multiple sampling methods and extensive effort are applied.},

	abstract = {Insects feeding on plant sap, blood, and other nutritionally incomplete diets are typically associated with mutualistic bacteria that supplement missing nutrients. Herbivorous mammal dung contains more than 86\% cellulose and lacks amino acids essential for insect development and reproduction. Yet one of the most ecologically necessary and evolutionarily successful groups of beetles, the dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) feeds primarily, or exclusively, on dung. These associations suggest that dung beetles may benefit from mutualistic bacteria that provide nutrients missing from dung. The nesting behaviors of the female parent and the feeding behaviors of the larvae suggest that a microbiome could be vertically transmitted from the parental female to her offspring through the brood ball. Using sterile rearing and a combination of molecular and culture-based techniques, we examine transmission of the microbiome in the bull-headed dung beetle, Onthophagus taurus. Beetles were reared on autoclaved dung and the microbiome was characterized across development. A {\textasciitilde}1425 bp region of the 16S rRNA identified Pseudomonadaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Comamonadaceae as the most common bacterial families across all life stages and populations, including cultured isolates from the 3rd instar digestive system. Finer level phylotyping analyses based on lepA and gyrB amplicons of cultured isolates placed the isolates closest to Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia stuartii, Pusillimonas sp., Pedobacter heparinus, and Lysinibacillus sphaericus. Scanning electron micrographs of brood balls constructed from sterile dung reveals secretions and microbes only in the chamber the female prepares for the egg. The use of autoclaved dung for rearing, the presence of microbes in the brood ball and offspring, and identical 16S rRNA sequences in both parent and offspring suggests that the O. taurus female parent transmits specific microbiome members to her offspring through the brood chamber. The transmission of the dung beetle microbiome highlights the maintenance and likely importance of this newly-characterized bacterial community.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (BEF) literature is dominated by investigations conducted in temperate grassland ecosystems under homogenous environmental conditions. Consequently, studies concerned with the functional importance of higher trophic levels, or with the role of environmental conditions in shaping BEF relationships, are comparatively uncommon. To address this, we assessed dung beetle diversity-functioning relationships in situ, in a ﬁeld experiment in the Brazilian Amazon. Dung beetles perform a number of ecological functions in habitats across the globe; in tropical forests they play a key role in the secondary dispersal of seeds. We therefore experimentally tested how the functional diversity of dung beetle communities affects seed dispersal and how BEF relationships varied with environmental context, by replicating the experiments under contrasting soil conditions. Relationships between dung beetle diversity and function were examined using diversity indices calculated using continuous morphological traits of the individuals involved in experiments, and functioning was measured as the dispersion of artiﬁcial seeds throughout the soil proﬁle and the probability of burial. Ninety experimental plots were established across three distinct primary forest sites. We collected, identiﬁed, and measured almost 2000 beetles, and sieved around 11 Mg of soil to quantify the dispersion of 1800 seed mimics. There was a signiﬁcant effect of dung beetle functional diversity on both seed dispersion and seed burial, although this depended on environmental context, with the strength or direction of responses differing across the contrasting soils. Regardless of soil type, functional richness, but not species richness, predicted seed dispersion. We therefore advocate the use of functional diversity indices over taxonomic approaches in dung beetle-focused BEF investigations. Furthermore, we highlight the difﬁculties in generalizing BEF relationships, even considering a single function within the same ecosystem.},

Additionally, we analyzed of the nutrient quality of each dung type. In total, 9,089 dung beetles from 15 species were captured in 2 yr of sampling. We found signiÞcant differences (P Ͻ 0.05) in mean dung beetle capture among omnivore, herbivore, and carnivore dung, as well as differences in individual species preference for dung type. Omnivore dung was the most attractive with chimpanzee and human dung having the highest mean capture (291.1 Ϯ 27.6 and 287.5 Ϯ 28.5 respectively). Carrion also was highly attractive with a mean of 231.9 Ϯ 20.6 beetles per trap (N ϭ 8). Our results suggest deÞnitive local preference of carrion in Phanaeus vindex Macleay and Onthophagus hecate (Panzer), while the congener, O. pennsylvanicus (Harold), was rarely captured in carrion and highly preferred omnivore dung. Preference for a speciÞc bait type does not appear to be correlated with dung quality, mammalian diet, or origin of mammal. Results suggest niche segregation by dung type among dung beetle species.},

	abstract = {Using corridors for conservation is increasing despite a lack of consensus on their efficacy. Specifically, whether corridors increase movement of plants and animals between habitat fragments has been addressed on a case-by-case basis with mixed results. Because of the growing number of well-designed experiments that have addressed this question, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether corridors increase movement; whether corridor effectiveness differs among taxa; how recent changes in experimental design have influenced findings; and whether corridor effectiveness differs between manipulative and natural experiments. To conduct our meta-analysis, we analyzed 78 experiments from 35 studies using a conservative hierarchical Bayesian model that accounts for hierarchical and sampling dependence. We found a highly significant result that corridors increase movement between habitat patches by approximately 50\% compared to patches that are not connected with corridors. We found that corridors were more important for the movement of invertebrates, nonavian vertebrates, and plants than they were for birds. Recent methodological advances in corridor experiments, such as controlling for the area added by corridors, did not influence whether corridors increased movement, whereas controlling for the distance between source and connected or unconnected recipient patches decreased movement through corridors. After controlling for taxa differences and whether studies controlled for distance in experimental design, we found that natural corridors (those existing in landscapes prior to the study) showed more movement than manipulated corridors (those created and maintained for the study). Our results suggest that existing corridors increase species movement in fragmented landscapes and that efforts spent on maintaining and creating corridors are worthwhile.},

We assessed the utility of corridors for promoting seed dispersal by birds during both summer and winter in a well-replicated corridor experiment conducted in early successional longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savannah habitat at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, USA. We used a single species of bird-dispersed fruiting plant, American black nightshade (Solanum americanum), and controlled the timing and number of fruits available to birds during summer and winter. Corridors increased long-distance seed dispersal during winter but not during summer, indicating that the effectiveness of corridors for promoting long-distance seed dispersal can depend upon plant reproductive timing and seasonal differences in bird movement. A better understanding of the seasonality of plant-animal interactions will permit better predictions about whether and how corridors provide connectivity for plants.},

            Understanding how widespread human-induced global changes are affecting the movement and dispersal of organisms is critical for maintaining species diversity and making sound land management decisions. In contrast with animal-dispersed species, little is known about how wind-dispersed species are affected by conservation strategies such as corridors. We use a combination of mechanistic models and field data to show that habitat corridors alter wind dynamics in a way that promotes seed dispersal and appears to increase plant diversity. Wind direction also interacts with landscape orientation to determine when corridors can provide connectivity.
          , 
            Determining how widespread human-induced changes such as habitat loss, landscape fragmentation, and climate instability affect populations, communities, and ecosystems is one of the most pressing environmental challenges. Critical to this challenge is understanding how these changes are affecting the movement abilities and dispersal trajectories of organisms and what role conservation planning can play in promoting movement among remaining fragments of suitable habitat. Whereas evidence is mounting for how conservation strategies such as corridors impact animal movement, virtually nothing is known for species dispersed by wind, which are often mistakenly assumed to not be limited by dispersal. Here, we combine mechanistic dispersal models, wind measurements, and seed releases in a large-scale experimental landscape to show that habitat corridors affect wind dynamics and seed dispersal by redirecting and bellowing airflow and by increasing the likelihood of seed uplift. Wind direction interacts with landscape orientation to determine when corridors provide connectivity. Our results predict positive impacts of connectivity and patch shape on species richness of wind-dispersed plants, which we empirically illustrate using 12 y of data from our experimental landscapes. We conclude that habitat fragmentation and corridors strongly impact the movement of wind-dispersed species, which has community-level consequences.},

Fire ants have two social forms: polygyne, which tend to disperse poorly but establish at high densities, and monogyne, which disperse widely but establish at lower densities. In landscapes dominated by polygyne fire ants, fire ant abundance was higher and native ant diversity was lower in habitat patches connected by corridors than in unconnected patches. Conversely, in landscapes dominated by monogyne fire ants, connectivity had no influence on fire ant abundance and native ant diversity. Polygyne fire ants dominated recently created landscapes, suggesting that these corridor effects may be transient.

“Although live fences do not host a diversity similar to forest patches, the data obtained are in agreement with other studies suggesting that this type of habitats function as biological corridors for Scarabaeinae species, allowing them to move between forest remnants and, thus, reducing competition for resource availability mainly for those species that avoid open areas (Estrada et al. 1998; Díaz et al. 2010; RangelAcosta and Martínez-Hernández2017).” (“Importance of live fences for dung beetle assemblage connectivity in a fragmented landscape”, 2023, p. 9)

“Although the pasture areas presented the lowest species richness, they had high values of abundance, due to the predominance of heliophilous species (i.e.,D.gazella, P.balthasar, iand P.demon), which are favored by the continuity of large extensions of open areas, with the presence of greater volumes of cattle manure, which allows them to maintain much larger populations (Montes de Oca \& Halffter 1998; Arellano et al.2008; Edmonds and Zídek 2012; Arellano et al. 2013).”
(“Importance of live fences for dung beetle assemblage connectivity in a fragmented landscape”, 2023, p. 10)
Maybe important for our study. potentially could see higher abundance of open space species in our connected fragments as opposed to high richness.

Might be an interesting contrast to our study since this is looking at the opposite scenario from our connected patches

	abstract = {Dung beetles are one of the most representative groups of insects associated with livestock, as they take advantage of the manure of livestock for food and reproduction. They have been widely used as a bio-indicator group to evaluate their responses to land-use change and other environmental disturbances by analyzing species diversity at different spatial and temporal scales. However, the impacts of livestock management practices, forms, and history on dung beetle diversity are still poorly understood. This paper is an exhaustive and systematic review of the existing peer-reviewed and indexed literature on the taxonomic diversity (species richness and composition), functional diversity, and ecological functions of dung beetles from different provinces and biogeographic domains in tropical grazing lands of the Neotropics. We analyzed the timeline of the studies conducted so far, and we detected increasing literature produced mainly in South America. We included the most frequent objectives, tendencies, software, and statistical analyses. Given the significant heterogeneity of livestock landscapes in the Neotropics, the reviewed studies have conceptualized broadly what a pasture is, and the authors have used different descriptions of other grazing lands. Additionally, management data and livestock practices vary widely among studies, and management history is poorly described. In future research, it is relevant to include as much information as possible and the consequences of different livestock management practices on additional ecological attributes of dung beetle assemblages at different landscape scales (spatial and temporal) to predict how ecological processes change in Neotropical landscapes. Considering the importance of the data to be included in future work, we propose a collection format to unify the information collected in the field when conducting ecological studies in grazing lands. Moreover, we define a classification system to homogenize the features that distinguish the multiple tropical grazing lands reported in the literature. Preserving dung beetle diversity and associated ecological functions is urgent for maintaining ecosystem services in grazing lands. The challenge for research institutions is to continue filling gaps in knowledge to help those who work in transferring knowledge, to help ranchers exercise better options for more sustainable livestock farming, and to publish results for conservation decision-making.},

The taxa selected were ants, butterflies, and dung beetles, all of which are taxonomically well known and could be considered bioindicator groups. The sampling design encompassed four habitats, namely rain-forest interior, rain-forest edge, rain-forest linear strip (corridor), and arable land. Ants and dung beetles were sampled using baited pitfall traps, and visual surveys were used to census butterflies. Potential increase in dispersal was examined by first identifying those species that specialized on the rain-forest interior habitat and then determining whether these species were present in the linear strips as opposed to the surrounding arable land. Two species of butterfly and two species of dung beetle were identified as rain-forest interior specialists, and two of these species were found in the linear strips but not in the arable habitat. This result supports the concept that the presence of corridors can increase the potentialfor dispersal of these species. But the remaining rain-forest interior species did not occur in the linear strips, which suggests that corridors will not increase dispersalfor these species.},

The invasive fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, has two social forms. The polygyne form has limited dispersal abilities relative to the monogyne form. Our previous work in a large-scale corridor experiment showed that in landscapes dominated by the polygyne form, fire ant density was higher and native ant species richness was lower in habitat patches connected by corridors than in unconnected patches. We expected that these observed corridor effects would be transient, that is, that fire ant density and native ant species richness differences between connected and unconnected patches would diminish over time as fire ants eventually fully established within patches. We tested this prediction by resampling the three landscapes dominated by polygyne fire ants 6 to 11 years after our original study. Differences in fire ant density between connected and unconnected habitat patches in these landscapes decreased, as expected. Differences in native ant species richness were variable but lowest in the last 2 years of sampling. These findings support our prediction of transient corridor effects on this invasive ant and stress the importance of temporal dynamics in assessing population and community impacts of habitat connectivity.},

Movement and abundance patterns observed for both species and sexes showed opposite responses to the percentage of forest cover and edge density. The specialist species showed a higher abundance, lower movement and spatial distribution limited to the forest, whereas the generalist species showed a lower abundance, higher movement and unrestricted distribution. For both species, males tended to travel longer distances than females, but we observed no difference in the movement metrics between sexes.

Because seeds are expected to end up in favourable and safe germination sites, it is considered as an example of directed dispersal. However, literature so far is restricted to tropical rain forest ecosystems, while data for temperate regions are lacking. In this study, the effect of dung beetles on seedling establishment of endozoochorically dispersed seeds is evaluated for a temperate grassland ecosystem. We performed a ﬁeld experiment in which cages excluded dung beetles from horse and cattle dung samples with mixed-in grass seeds. Seed germination from these samples was signiﬁcantly higher than that from samples which were accessible to dung beetles. This indicates that the effect of dung beetles on short-term seedling establishment was negative, which contrasts with the patterns found for large-seeded species used in tropical studies. This is most likely attributed to the lack of roller species and the larger depth at which tunneling Geotrupes species bury seeds.},

Corridors are thought to increase the exchange of individuals between habitat patches, promoting genetic exchange and reducing population fluctuations. Empirical studies addressing the effects of corridors have either been small in scale or have ignored confounding effects of increased habitat area created by the presence of a corridor. These methodological difficulties, coupled with a paucity of studies examining the effects of corridors on plants and plant–animal interactions, have sparked debate over the purported value of corridors in conservation planning. We report results of a large-scale experiment that directly address this debate. In eight large-scale experimental landscapes that control for patch area and test alternative mechanisms of corridor function, we demonstrate that corridors not only increase the exchange of animals between patches, but also facilitate two key plant–animal interactions: pollination and seed dispersal. Our results show that the beneficial effects of corridors extend beyond the area they add, and suggest that increased plant and animal movement through corridors will have positive impacts on plant populations and community interactions in fragmented landscapes.},

In ﬁeld experiments using dung of the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), we investigated the depths that dung beetles (Onthophagus atripennis, Onthophagus lenzii, and Phelotrupes auratus) buried seeds (4.8e6.8 mm diameter) and plastic markers (2 or 5 mm diameter), the levels of predation on buried and unburied seeds, and germination rates of seeds buried to different depths. All three species buried the 2-mm markers, but only P. auratus buried the seeds and 5-mm markers. There were seasonal differences in mean seed burial rates (range, 27e51\%) and depths (range, 1e27 mm). Signiﬁcantly more seeds were buried in June, July, and September than in August or October, and the mean burial depth was signiﬁcantly deeper in June and July. Most seeds and markers were buried to a 3e6 cm depth. Germination of seeds that were positioned at depths of 1e4 cm was signiﬁcantly greater than that of seeds left on the surface or buried at greater depths. Buried seeds were less likely to disappear than seeds at the surface, which may reﬂect differential predation.

	abstract = {Grassland ecosystems undergo dramatic habitat loss and fragmentation worldwide due to agricultural expansion and intensification. Among different taxonomic groups, grassland arthropods are particularly sensitive to this process and, therefore, are exposed to considerable risk. Although many studies focus on land use impacts on arthropod diversity, these mostly consider taxonomic diversity and neglect trait-mediated functional responses. However, studying functional diversity often provides more accurate insights into ecosystem processes. Here, we assessed the effect of fragment size and connectivity on the functional composition (community-weighted mean trait values) and diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy) of two diverse and abundant arthropod groups: spiders and true bugs. We assigned functional traits for more than 300 species collected from 30 sandy steppe (forest-steppes) and 30 loess steppe fragments (kurgans) in the southern part of the Hungarian Great Plain. Functional responses to fragmentation were observed for spiders in forest-steppes and for true bugs in kurgans. We found higher functional diversity in better-connected fragments for spiders and in small fragments for both groups. We collected small, humidity-preferring and web-building spiders in small fragments, and there were more ballooning spiders with moist habitat preferences in well-connected fragments. Furthermore, increasing grassland connectivity resulted in a significantly higher proportion of polyphagous and humidity-preferring individuals in the true bug communities. Our results highlight the importance of small grassland fragments in maintaining high arthropod functional diversity. Even small fragments in a well-connected grassland network can promote ecosystem functioning and associated services within human-dominated landscapes.},

The criteria address sustainable population sizes (tested using population viability analysis), habitat area needed to support sustainable populations, and measures of functional connectivity derived from radiotelemetry data and patch occupancy models. We then applied the criteria in three real-world demonstration landscapes, first, to predict numbers of breeding territories potentially accommodated within patch configurations and, second, to evaluate increases that might be achieved if landscape connections among isolated patches were restored (e.g., using corridors). The best connected of the three demonstration landscapes was predicted to support large sustainable populations without intervention to restore connectivity, whereas none of the patch configurations was sustainable in the most fragmented landscape, with or without corridor restoration. Notably, however, corridor restoration in the landscape with an intermediate fragmentation level was expected to quadruple the sustainable Chucao population and potentially prevent regional Huet-huet extinction. Thus, our network criteria provide a simple approach for developing and evaluating spatially explicit prescriptions for conservation planning in this highly endangered biome. The criteria may be especially useful for discriminating among landscapes where restoration of connectivity is, or is not, an appropriate course of action.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Because of widespread habitat fragmentation, maintenance of landscape connectivity has become a major focus of conservation planning, but empirical tests of animal movement in fragmented landscapes remain scarce. We conducted a translocation experiment to test the relative permeability of three landscape elements (open habitat, shrubby secondary vegetation, and wooded corridors) to movement by the Chucao Tapaculo (Scelorchilus rubecula), a forest understory bird endemic to South American temperate rainforest. Forty-one radio-tagged subjects were translocated (individually) to three landscape treatments consisting of small release patches that were either entirely surrounded by open habitat (pasture), entirely surrounded by dense shrubs, or linked to other patches by wooded corridors that were otherwise surrounded by open matrix. The number of days subjects remained in release patches before dispersal (a measure of habitat resistance) was significantly longer for patches surrounded by open habitat than for patches adjoining corridors or surrounded by dense shrubs. These results indicate that open habitat significantly constrains Chucao dispersal, in accord with expectation, but dispersal occurs equally well through wooded corridors and shrub-dominated matrix. Thus, corridor protection or restoration and management of vegetation in the matrix (to encourage animal movement) may be equally feasible alternatives for maintaining connectivity.},

	abstract = {Although many tropical savannas are highly inﬂuenced by humans, the patterns of biodiversity loss in these systems remain poorly understood. In particular, the biodiversity consequences of replacing native grasslands with exotic pastures have not been studied. Here we examine how the conversion of the native savanna grasslands affects dung beetle communities. Our study was conducted in 14 native (grassland: campo limpo), and 21 exotic (Urochloa spp. monoculture) pastures in Carrancas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We collected 4996 dung beetle individuals from 66 species: 3139 individuals from 50 species in native pastures and 1857 individuals from 55 species in the exotic pastures. Exotic pastures had lower dung beetle richness, abundance and biomass than native pastures. Species composition between the two pasture types was signiﬁcantly different and exotic pastures were dominated by few abundant species. Indicator species analysis detected 16 species indicators of native pastures and three of exotic pastures, according to relative abundance and frequency in each pasture system. Our results show that the conversion of native pastures to exotic pastures leads to a predictable loss of local species richness, increasing dominance and changes in species composition. These results highlight the importance of maintaining native pastures in the Cerrado agro-pastoral landscape.},

	abstract = {Dispersal of seeds away from the parent plant may facilitate escape from density-dependent seed mortality. However, many post-dispersal events can have a profound inﬂuence on the survival of dispersed seeds. By incorporating seeds in the dung that dung beetles process for consumption and oviposition, dung beetles could enhance seed survival if they remove seeds from areas of high predation risk and place them in locations that avoid subsequent predation and that are suitable for germination. The role of dung beetles in seed survival was investigated over 15 mo in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Depths of seeds buried by beetles, levels of predation on buried and unburied seeds, and germination success of seeds buried to different depths were examined. Results suggest that by burying seeds dung beetles increase the probability that seeds will escape predation and germinate. Of seeds placed in dungpiles, 69\% remained at the surface, while 25\% were buried from 1–3 cm in depth. Larger seeds were buried more shallowly than smaller seeds. Buried seeds were less likely to be removed by predators than seeds at the surface. Germination of seeds buried at 1- and 3-cm depths was signiﬁcantly higher than seeds buried at 10 cm. For the species tested, many seeds were buried by dung beetles between 1 and 3 cm and at this depth there was a high probability of escaping predators and germinating. This demonstrates the potential ecological importance of dung beetles in facilitating seed survival and provides data to consider the role of dung beetles in the evolution of seed attributes.},

Interspecific competition may be mitigated to some extent by large-scale spatial (e.g., habitat type) and temporal (e.g., seasonal) variation in activity. Niche partitioning also occurs at the scale of individual dung pads. We examined the extent to which inter- and intraspecific variation in adult morphology and behavior contribute to spatial and temporal partitioning above and below the dung pad in the dung beetle community of Kibale Forest, Uganda. Excavations in the vicinity of dung pads revealed significant heterogeneity among species and guilds in the lateral distance between tunnels and dung, and in tunnel depth. Patterns of succession and diel activity demonstrated strong temporal dissociations among guilds. In one species, Onthophagus multicornis, we found a bimodal distribution of male horn sizes and a tunneling pattern consistent with alternative reproductive tactics.},

However, this practice may have unintended environmental impacts mediated by interactions among the wide range of micro- and macroorganisms found in agroecosystems. For example, antibiotics may alter microbial emissions of greenhouse gases by affecting livestock gut microbiota. Furthermore, antibiotics may affect the microbiota of non-target animals that rely on dung, such as dung beetles, and the ecosystem services they provide. To examine these interactions, we treated cattle with a commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotic and assessed downstream effects on microbiota in dung and dung beetles, greenhouse gas fluxes from dung, and beetle size, survival and reproduction. We found that antibiotic treatment restructured microbiota in dung beetles, which harboured a microbial community distinct from those in the dung they were consuming. The antibiotic effect on beetle microbiota was not associated with smaller size or lower numbers. Unexpectedly, antibiotic treatment raised methane fluxes from dung, possibly by altering the interactions between methanogenic archaea and bacteria in rumen and dung environments. Our findings that antibiotics restructure dung beetle microbiota and modify greenhouse gas emissions from dung indicate that antibiotic treatment may have unintended, cascading ecological effects that extend beyond the target animal.},

	abstract = {Surprisingly little research has evaluated how habitat size may limit the population size of species that use different habitats at different stages of their lives. Here we develop simple discretetime models to describe the population dynamics of species that use separate juvenile and adult habitats. Analytic solutions, model simulations, and elasticity and sensitivity analyses show that adult abundance is only limited by the size of the juvenile habitat when both adult habitat size and recruitment are much larger than juvenile habitat size. Juvenile habitat plays a marginally greater role in limiting population size for species with closed populations, where recruitment is proportional to adult abundance, versus open populations. Because adult populations often accumulate pulses of juveniles, adult habitat size can strongly limit population size over a broad range of parameter values, an effect that increases as the longevity of a species increases. Limited empirical research from a range of taxa supports these model predictions, although few studies were designed to actually test the limiting role of juvenile versus adult habitat. Future research must carefully evaluate whether and how processes at the juvenile stage affect adult abundance, and conservation efforts may be able to use this model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness, vis-a`-vis increasing adult abundance, of time and money allocated to protecting juvenile habitats.},

One of the species, O. gazella, is a foreign introduction, and comparative laboratory food procurement experiments revealed the superior ability of this species to obtain and remove dung from the soil surface. A confrontation experiment also demonstrated the behavioral dominance of O. gazella. A food-choice experiment indicated a more restricted diet for O. gazella than for the other two species. Implications for the future prospects of the two native species are discussed.},

Cascading effects of species extinction across dependent species groups are likely to occur in coprophagous beetles, because these invertebrates rely on mammal dung for food and nesting material. Both mammals and dung beetles provide important ecosystem services and cascading effects are likely to lead to rapid functional losses. In this study, we described changes in dung beetle communities across a gradient of selective defaunation in continuous Brazilian Atlantic rain forest. We compared the dung beetle assemblages in seven sites with different mammalian biomass and composition. The reduction in the mammalian biomass had a major effect on dung beetle communities by (1) increasing dung beetle abundance with decreasing overall mammal, primate and large mammal biomasses, (2) decreasing dung beetle species richness with decreasing overall mammal biomass and (3) decreasing dung beetle size with decreasing large mammal biomass. Moreover, our study demonstrated the importance of the composition of mammal communities in structuring dung beetle communities. This study documented how selective changes in mammalian biomass and composition affect dung beetle species communities, which in turn may have cascading consequences for the ecosystem. Since most of tropical ecosystems are facing dramatic changes in mammalian composition, it is urgent to evaluate the functional losses associated with such co-extinctions.},

	abstract = {Insect rearing systems are widely used in biological control, experiments, and for food supply including single, multiple, and mass rearing from small to large scales. An example of a reared taxon is the dung beetles, a speciose cosmo- politan group that provides essential ecosystem services to the environment. Dung beetle species have been translocated into several countries, such as Australia, United States, and Brazil, in ongoing efforts to fill niches not occupied by native fauna. The success of these programs depends on the capacity to rear sufficient numbers for successful field release, estab- lishment, and experimental information; a task that needs to consider its reproductive biology. Many species of dung beetle are univoltine, long-lived, exhibit parental care, and produce small numbers of progeny. Rearing conditions need to pro- mote the production of large, well-nourished, and fecund individuals. In this review, we synthesize the scarce literature on dung beetle rearing and appraise the abiotic and biotic factors that influence rearing initiatives. We identify major research priorities that allow the optimization of these programs. The published data focus on a restricted range of taxa. Further, the influence of factors such as soil moisture and composition, rearing media, temperature, and biotic interactions are poorly understood. Consequently, even for large-scale and well-funded projects, there is heavy reliance on institutional knowledge and anecdotal reports, with few published experimental evaluations. The most imperative goal for optimizing progeny is to conduct rigorous experiments with a wider range of taxa that lead to establishing efficient and specific rearing strategies and programs.},

	abstract = {The population dynamics of insects in a spatially fragmented environment were studied by examining three main aspects of their ecology, namely, rates of local population extinction, density dependence in population change, and movements between population. Ten phytophagous insects and seven parasitoids inhabiting the flowerheads of two herbaceous plants, Centaurea nigra and Arctium minus, were studied by monitoring their populations on more than 50 patches of each plant, scattered over 5 km2 of arable farmland. The results were used to test the relative importance of immigration and of local population regulation to population persistence. This paper describes the rates of local extinction of the various species and the density-dependent factors operating on their populations. Local extinction was found to be a regular feature of these populations, especially on the smaller patches of the plants. Density dependence was identified in the changes in population sizes between generations of eight species (five herbivores and three parasitoids). Parasitoids appeared to be incapable of regulating their host populations, in the four host species for which we have data. Populations of all species were, however, limited by their food resources, and their numbers tracked changes, both spatially and temporally, in resource availability. The implications of these findings to population theory are discussed.},

	abstract = {Natural habitats are small islands in the sea of human environment. Area loss and fragmentation affect seriously the survival of species, for small, isolated populations are exposed to several risks. As the area of suitable habitats decreases, one way to escape local extinction is to migrate between habitats through ecological corridors, and utilize the whole metapopulation landscape. Thus, natural and designed corridors can be key elements for survival. Here, we present a method to study corridor pattern from a reliability-theory viewpoint. We analyze the probability of successful migration in a metapopulation landscape network of habitats, stepping stones and corridors. We examine the situation when individuals of a local population must migrate from a disturbed, critical habitat to others. In the landscape graph, points represent habitats and stepping stones, while edges represent corridors. If corridors can be destroyed, migration probability depends on the pattern of permeable corridors. Engineered corridors can enhance the reliability of migration, depending on their position in the network. We present some general rules for designing reliable landscape patterns (e.g. ‘necklace’ arrangement is less reliable for migration than ‘loop’). Then, we illustrate our viewpoint by presenting two hypothetical landscape networks and comparing the possibilities for designing reliable corridor topologies by creating one engineered corridor. Further, we determine the preferred topology for the engineered corridor. Our hope is that this reliability-theory analysis will stimulate further development of the method and in the fieldwork.},

How fragmentation affects populations depends on the rate at which individuals move between spatially separated patches. Whereas negative effects of habitat loss on biodiversity are well known, the effects of fragmentation per se on population dynamics and ecosystem stability remain less well understood. Here, we use a spatially explicit predator–prey model to investigate how the interplay between fragmentation and optimal foraging behaviour affects predator–prey interactions and, subsequently, ecosystem stability. We study systems wherein prey occupies isolated patches and are consumed by predators that disperse following Lévy random walks. Our results show that the Lévy exponent and the degree of fragmentation jointly determine coexistence probabilities. In highly fragmented landscapes, Brownian and ballistic predators go extinct and only scale-free predators can coexist with prey. Furthermore, our results confirm that predation causes irreversible habitat loss in fragmented landscapes owing to overexploitation of smaller patches of prey. Moreover, we show that predator dispersal can reduce, but not prevent or minimize, the amount of lost habitat. Our results suggest that integrating optimal foraging theory into population and landscape ecology is crucial to assessing the impact of fragmentation on biodiversity and ecosystem stability.},

They constitute important prey items for vertebrate predators and influence vegetation structure and regeneration. Assessing the population dynamics of rodents in burnt areas, whether individuals originate from in situ survival or from ex situ immigration, is therefore a key question in understanding the recovery of trophic networks after disturbance. This study aimed to identify the recovery strategies of rodent populations in recently burnt forests in the Mediterranean basin using body condition, reproductive output, sex ratios, and distance covered by wood mice and Algerian mice. Sampling stations were set up at increasing distances from the perimeter of recently burnt areas. Rodents were captured using Sherman traps and measured. Wood mice and Algerian mice lived syntopically within the recently burnt areas studied, the former species being more abundant and the second one selecting drier areas. Results indicated that time since fire, shrub cover, and distance to the perimeter of the burnt area influenced wood mice and Algerian mice population structures. Adult female wood mice mainly remained close to the burnt area perimeter, due to this species' matriarchal structure, while juvenile males dispersed farther into the burnt area. Adult females were also recaptured more frequently than other age and sex categories over time, whereas males covered greater distances. These findings suggest that the recovery strategy of these widespread Mediterranean rodents is mainly driven by ex situ immigration from unburnt areas. These results will be useful for post-fire management decisions such as non-intervention, salvage logging or the conservation of open areas, given that mice are a fundamental component of the ecosystem. Results also suggest that management should focus on maintaining good connectivity between burnt and adjacent unburnt areas to support mice populations and facilitate other longer-term conservation benefits.},

	abstract = {Dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory offers a perspective on population ecology whose starting point is energy utilization by, and homeostasis within, individual organisms. It is natural to ask what it adds to the existing large body of individual-based ecological theory. We approach this question pragmatically—through detailed study of the individual physiology and population dynamics of the zooplankter
              Daphnia
              and its algal food. Standard DEB theory uses several state variables to characterize the state of an individual organism, thereby making the transition to population dynamics technically challenging, while ecologists demand maximally simple models that can be used in multi-scale modelling. We demonstrate that simpler representations of individual bioenergetics with a single state variable (size), and two life stages (juveniles and adults), contain sufficient detail on mass and energy budgets to yield good fits to data on growth, maturation and reproduction of individual
              Daphnia
              in response to food availability. The same simple representations of bioenergetics describe some features of
              Daphnia
              mortality, including enhanced mortality at low food that is not explicitly incorporated in the standard DEB model. Size-structured, population models incorporating this additional mortality component resolve some long-standing questions on stability and population cycles in
              Daphnia
              . We conclude that a bioenergetic model serving solely as a ‘regression’ connecting organismal performance to the history of its environment can rest on simpler representations than those of standard DEB. But there are associated costs with such pragmatism, notably loss of connection to theory describing interspecific variation in physiological rates. The latter is an important issue, as the type of detailed study reported here can only be performed for a handful of species.},

Still, many IBMs are data hungry, species specific, and time-consuming to develop and analyze. Many of these issues would be resolved by using general theories of individual dynamics as the basis for IBMs. While such theories have frequently been examined at the individual level, few cross-level tests exist that also try to predict population dynamics. Here we performed a cross-level test of dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory by parameterizing an individual-based model using individual-level data of the water flea, Daphnia magna, and comparing the emerging population dynamics to independent data from population experiments. We found that DEB theory successfully predicted population growth rates and peak densities but failed to capture the decline phase. Further assumptions on food-dependent mortality of juveniles were needed to capture the population dynamics after the initial population peak. The resulting model then predicted, without further calibration, characteristic switches between small- and large-amplitude cycles, which have been observed for Daphnia. We conclude that cross-level tests help detect gaps in current individual-level theories and ultimately will lead to theory development and the establishment of a generic basis for individual-based models and ecology.},

Emulating Darwin's approach, patterns in plant, insect herbivore, and carnivore relationships, based on empirical observations, are summarized, arguing for recognition of strong influences passing up through trophic webs, from plants to herbivores to carnivores, and of pattern imposed by a landscape represented by all stages of ecological succession. Hypotheses accounting for linkage among the empirical patterns are erected in the form of flow diagrams of influence. Unanswered questions and the need for further testing of hypotheses are discussed in the hope of fostering more concentrated effort in the development of a theory on insect herbivore population dynamics.},

This problem is related to the optimal foraging theory. According to U. Dieckmann’s suggestion, the population distribution by patches should be modeled according to the utility function that takes into account the amount of resources per patch, the population–patch distance, and the extent to which the population is aware of the amount of resources in the patch. In this case, the population distribution by patches is described using the Boltzmann distribution. Dieckmann considers a static problem without taking into account the change in the position of the population over time. In this paper, we suggest a dynamic system that describes the population distribution by patches, which depends on the utility of patches that changes over time as a result of variations in the population–patch distance. That said, the Boltzmann distribution is a particular solution of the derived system of ordinary differential equations. The Lyapunov stability condition for the Boltzmann distribution is derived. The patch utility functions dependent on the distance to and the population’s awareness of the patch are introduced. As a result, in the 2D case the R2 space in divided in preferential utility domains. This partition generalizes G.F. Voronoy’s diagram.},

Here, we review 41 CRP studies in the fields of ecology, biodiversity conservation and environmental science that collectively identify 2031 research priorities. We demonstrate that climate change, ecosystem services and protected areas are common terms found in the research priorities of many CRP studies, and that identified research priorities have become less unique over time. In addition, we show that there is a considerable variation in the size and composition of the groups involved in CRP studies, and that at least one aspect of the identified research priorities (lexical diversity) is related to the size of the CRP group. Although some CRP studies have been highly cited, the evidence that CRP studies have directly motivated research is weak, perhaps because most CRP studies have not directly involved organizations that fund science. We suggest that the most important impact of CRP studies may lie in their ability to connect individuals across sectors and help to build diverse communities of practice around important issues at the science–policy interface.},

This study aimed to determine the role of the eco–corridor and the biodiversity of ground beetles near eco–corridors constructed between areas divided for a prolonged period. As a center of the Chupungryeong eco–corridor, Bongsan–myeon, Gimcheon–si, Gyeongsangbuk–do on the Gyeongbu expressway, four sites were examined. To confirm the movement of beetles on the bridge, we used the capture–recapture method by marking specimens around 5 cm belonging to Carabus jankowskii, Eucarabus sternbergi, and Carabus semiopacus. On the other hand, pitfall traps in each opposite area were used to investigate the biodiversity of ground beetles. Our results indicated that ground beetles moved between separated habitats using eco–corridors. In addition, the collections showed different diversities at each site. These results confirmed the important role of the eco–corridor in walking animals, although more detailed research is required. Additionally, these results provide baseline data for future eco–corridor construction},

	abstract = {1. The decomposition of biological material produces a plethora of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are implicated in the foraging behaviour of coprophagous and necrophagous insects. Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) have an acute olfactory system used to locate food resources. Accordingly, identification of food resource VOCs potentially used in food location is integral to understanding dung beetle foraging ecology. 2. In this study, volatile emissions from dung and carrion of native and introduced animals in New Zealand were analysed using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Volatile profiles were compared via principal component analyses (PCAs) and cluster solutions based on attractiveness using canonical discriminant analysis (CDA). 3. A total of 115 compounds were detected from 21 food types. Statistical analyses showed that dung and carrion volatile profiles clustered according to attractiveness to the dung beetle Saphobius edwardsi, and that different dung types formed distinct clusters and grouped separately from carrion. 4. This study suggests that volatile profiles emitted by food resources used by dung beetles are complex, producing distinct odours, which potentially mediate foraging decisions.},

Working in large-scale, experimental landscapes in which open-habitat patches and corridors were created by harvesting pine forest, we showed that corridors direct movements of different types of species, including butterﬂies, small mammals, and bird-dispersed plants, causing higher movement between connected than between unconnected patches. Corridors directed the movement of all 10 species studied, with all corridor effect sizes Ͼ68\%. However, this corridor effect was signiﬁcant for ﬁve species, not signiﬁcant for one species, and inconclusive for four species because of small sample sizes.

	abstract = {Habitat loss is often considered the greatest near-term threat to biodiversity, while the impact of habitat fragmentation remains intensely debated. A key issue of this debate centers on the problem of scale–landscape or patch–at which to assess the consequences of fragmentation. Yet patterns are often confounded across scales, and experimental designs that could solve this scaling problem remain scarce. We conducted two field experiments in 30 experimental landscapes in which we manipulated habitat loss, fragmentation, and patch size for a community of four insect herbivores that specialize on the cactus Opuntia. In the first experiment, we destroyed 2088 Opuntia patches in either aggregated or random patterns and compared the relative effects of landscape-scale loss and fragmentation to those of local patch size on species occurrence. This experiment focused on manipulating the relative separation of remaining patches, where we hypothesized that aggregated loss would disrupt dispersal more than random loss, leading to lower occurrence. In the second experiment, we destroyed 759 Opuntia patches to generate landscapes that varied in patch number and size for a given amount of habitat loss and assessed species occurrence. This experiment focused on manipulating the subdivision of remaining habitat, where we hypothesized that an increase in the number of patches for a given amount of loss would lead to negative effects on occurrence. For both, we expected that occurrence would increase with patch size. We find strong evidence for landscape-scale effects of habitat fragmentation, with aggregated loss and a larger number of patches for a given amount of habitat loss leading to a lower frequency of patches occupied in landscapes. In both experiments, occurrence increased with patch size, yet interactions of patch size and landscape-scale loss and fragmentation drove species occurrence in patches. Importantly, the direction of effects were consistent across scales and effects of patch size were sufficient to predict the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation across entire landscapes. Our experimental results suggest that changes at both the patch and landscape scales can impact populations, but that a long-standing pattern—the patch-size effect—captures much of the key variation shaping patterns of species occurrence.},

Intensification of farming practices generally reduces species and functional diversity of terrestrial invertebrates, which may negatively affect ecosystem services. Here, we investigate the effects of cattle-grazing intensification on dung removal by dung beetles in field experiments replicated in 38 pastures around the world. Within each study site, we measured dung removal in pastures managed with low- and high-intensity regimes to assess between-regime differences in dung beetle diversity and dung removal, whilst also considering climate and regional variations. The impacts of intensification were heterogeneous, either diminishing or increasing dung beetle species richness, functional diversity, and dung removal rates. The effects of beetle diversity on dung removal were more variable across sites than within sites. Dung removal increased with species richness across sites, while functional diversity consistently enhanced dung removal within sites, independently of cattle grazing intensity or climate. Our findings indicate that, despite intensified cattle stocking rates, ecosystem services related to decomposition and nutrient cycling can be maintained when a functionally diverse dung beetle community inhabits the human-modified landscape.},

	abstract = {Most of our current knowledge about the behaviour of insects flying at high altitude has been derived directly from observations made with conventional entomological radars. Until recently it was not possible to apply this very powerful technique to study the behaviour of insects flying close to the ground because the strong radar echoes, reflected from ground features and from vegetation (‘clutter’), almost always mask the very weak signals returned from insects. This constraint has been overcome, at least for insects weighing more than ≈50 mg, by the development of an harmonic radar, and of transponder tags small enough to be carried by these insects without impeding their flight performance. Because the transponders have to be carried by insects in flight, extreme miniaturisation was obviously essential and it was achieved by using a passive, frequency-doubling technique, so that no on-board battery was needed. Transponders with all-up weights of between 1 and 12 mg were produced, the weights varying according to the degree of mechanical robustness required. The frequency-doubled signals from the transponder are selectively detected by the radar so that the tagged insects can be located even in the presence of very strong clutter. The system has three major advantages over conventional visual and video methods of observing low-flying insects. Firstly, and most importantly, its range of operation (up to 900 m) allows surveillance and flight tracking over hundreds of thousands of m2, i.e. four orders of magnitude greater than is possible with conventional methods. Secondly, it provides dynamic and geometrically correct records of the insects’ horizontal flight paths and thirdly, it works equally well by day and night. The technique has introduced a new era in the study of insect flight at low altitude.},

We show all the components of this new harmonic radar and its first application, the tracking of Vespa velutina (yellow-legged Asian hornet). This is an invasive species which, although indigenous to South-East Asia, is spreading quickly to other regions of the world. Because of its fast diffusion and the serious threat it poses to both honeybee colonies and to humans, control measures are mandatory. When equipped with a small passive transponder, this radar system can track the flight trajectory of insects and locate nests to be destroyed. This tool has potential not only for monitoring V. velutina but also for tracking other larger insects and small size vertebrates.},

	abstract = {The design, construction, and performance of a harmonic radar transponder with a total mass of less than 500 μg is presented. The transponder is intended for insect tracking applications and consists of very fine wire and a small Schottky diode. It is designed for fundamental and harmonic frequencies of 10 GHz and 20 GHz, respectively. Compared to existing harmonic radar transponders, this transponder is easy to construct because the loop inductor can be implemented with a simple bend in the dipole conductor without degrading performance. Through careful design optimization, the conversion loss of the transponder is not impacted by the measures taken to minimize its mass. The expected harmonic power versus the transmitted power is estimated based on the link analysis between the transmitter and receiver of the radar, with the link analysis itself being performed via calculation, harmonic balance simulation, and full-wave simulation. The link analysis simulation predicted a received power of -66.4 dBm for a transmitted power of +22 dBm and a range of 2.4 m. The measured received power level at the harmonic frequency, obtained from the broadside of the transponder in an anechoic test chamber, is approximately -70 dBm, which agrees well with the link analysis. Simulated and measured transponder radiation patterns are also compared and show good agreement. Low-mass transponders such as this enable tracking of smaller insects without reducing their lifespan or compromising their ability to fly at natural altitudes and ranges.},

Future monitoring techniques must be systematic and global. Advanced technologies and computer solutions are needed. We provide here a review of relevant works to show the high potential for solving the aforementioned problems. Major historical and modern methods of insect monitoring are considered. All major radar solutions are carefully reviewed. Insect monitoring with radar is a well established technique, but it is still a fast-growing topic. The paper provides an updated classification of insect radar sets. Three main groups of insect radar solutions are distinguished: scanning, vertical-looking, and harmonic. Pulsed radar sets are utilized for all three groups, while frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) systems are applied only for vertical-looking and harmonic insect radar solutions. This work proves the high potential of radar entomology based on the growing research interest, along with the emerging novel setups, compact devices, and data processing approaches. The review exposes promising insect monitoring solutions using compact radar instruments. The proposed compact and resource-effective setups can be very beneficial for systematic insect monitoring.},

Conventional monitoring methods of trapping and identification are time consuming and thus expensive. Automation would significantly improve the state of the art. Here, we present a network of distributed wireless sensors that moves the field towards automation by recording backscattered near-infrared modulation signatures from insects. The instrument is a compact sensor based on dual-wavelength infrared light emitting diodes and is capable of unsupervised, autonomous long-term insect monitoring over weather and seasons. The sensor records the backscattered light at kHz pace from each insect transiting the measurement volume. Insect observations are automatically extracted and transmitted with environmental metadata over cellular connection to a cloud-based database. The recorded features include wing beat harmonics, melanisation and flight direction. To validate the sensor’s capabilities, we tested the correlation between daily insect counts from an oil seed rape field measured with six yellow water traps and six sensors during a 4-week period. A comparison of the methods found a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient of 0.61 and a p-value = 0.0065, with the sensors recording approximately 19 times more insect observations and demonstrating a larger temporal dynamic than conventional yellow water trap monitoring.},

	abstract = {Characterising the frequency and timing of biological processes such as locomotion, eclosion or foraging, is often needed to get a complete picture of a species' ecology. Automated trackers are an invaluable tool for high-throughput collection of activity data and have become more accurate and efficient with advances in computer vision and deep learning. However, tracking activity of small and fast flying animals remains a hurdle, especially in a field setting with variable light conditions. Commercial activity monitors can be expensive, closed source and generally limited to laboratory settings. Here, we present a portable locomotion activity monitor (pLAM), a mobile activity detector to quantify small animal activity. Our setup uses inexpensive components, builds upon open-source motion tracking software, and is easy to assemble and use in the field. It runs off-grid, supports low-light tracking with infrared lights and can implement arbitrary light cycle colours and brightnesses with programmable LEDs. We provide a user-friendly guide to assembling pLAM hardware, accessing its pre-configured software and guidelines for using it in other systems. We benchmarked pLAM for insects under various laboratory and field conditions, then compared results to a commercial activity detector. They offer broadly similar activity measures, but our setup captures flight and bouts of motion that are often missed by beam breaking activity detection. pLAM can automate laboratory and field monitoring of activity and timing in a wide range of biological processes, including circadian rhythm, eclosion and diapause timing, pollination and flower foraging, or pest feeding activity. This low cost and easy setup allows high-throughput animal behaviour studies for basic and applied ecology and evolution research.},

	abstract = {Better understanding insects’ movements could help preserve and restore the insect communities that are key to the functioning of grasslands. Recent technological advances have led to spectacular achievements in movement ecology, making it possible to track the individual movements of a wide variety of organisms, including the smallest. However, monitoring systems such as RFID tags may negatively impact an organism’s life history, with potential consequences on the reliability of data and conclusions. This study explored the potential of passive RFID tags to track the movements of three small ground-dwelling beetle species, a predator (Poecilus sericeus, Carabidae), a detritivore (Asida sericea, Tenebrionidae) and a granivore (Acinopus picipes, Carabidae), in a Mediterranean dry grassland degraded by years of cultivation. First, we tested whether carrying tags might impact individuals’ behaviour, using a before-and-after design under laboratory conditions. Despite a trend toward shorter displacements, we found no significant short-term effect of the tags on individuals’ movements. Second, we tracked a total of 25 tagged beetles in their natural environment every 4 h for 48 h. We highlight the principal limitation of using passive tags with small terrestrial beetles: the antenna has to pass over the tags to detect them, which restricts tracking to a few consecutive days after which the probability of locating an individual is low. However, the data obtained sheds light on the biological rhythms and daily movement capabilities of our target species: A. sericea is more mobile and P. sericeus less mobile than expected. Such knowledge could help predict the species’ ability to recolonise degraded areas, enabling appropriate restoration actions to be designed based on landscape ecology principles.},

Recent studies have shown that the use of genetic information from dung beetle guts (invertebrate-derived DNA or iDNA) allows for the detection of mammals in a given habitat without intensively surveying the area. However, these studies used live or freshly killed beetles instead of preserved specimens. Here, we assessed the feasibility of extracting and sequencing iDNA from dung beetles that were collected using conventional baited pitfall traps with a mixture of propylene glycol and ethanol. We extracted iDNA from the guts of 18 dung beetles, comprising three species and three functional groups, collected from a seasonal tropical forest in Xishuangbanna, China. Eight mammalian species were detected, including rare species not previously recorded at the same location. Among the three functional groups, paracoprids (tunnelers) yielded the highest number of mammal species. Our study shows that iDNA can be successfully sequenced from preserved specimens, provided they are stored under appropriate conditions. The proposed technique offers a viable alternative to traditional cafeteria experiments for understanding dung beetle-mammal interactions and can serve as a valuable complementary approach to current mammal survey techniques.},

Even more remarkable is that these beetles return home moving backwards, with a pellet of dung between their hind legs. Here, we explore the strategy that S. galenus uses to find its way home. We find that, like many other insects, they use path integration to calculate the direction and distance to their home. If they fail to locate their burrow, the beetles initiate a distinct looping search behaviour that starts with a characteristic sharp turn, we have called a ‘turning point’. When homing beetles are passively displaced or transferred to an unfamiliar environment, they initiate a search at a point very close to the location of their fictive burrow—that is, a spot at the same relative distance and direction from the pick-up point as the original burrow. Unlike other insects, S. galenus do not appear to supplement estimates of the burrow location with landmark information. Thus, S. galenus represents a rare case of a consistently backward-homing animal that does not use landmarks to augment its path integration strategy.},

	abstract = {The current biodiversity crisis calls for rapid and wide-ranging surveys to assess living organisms. However, some taxa are more elusive than others, making monitoring challenging. This is the case for soil invertebrates, but new molecular technologies such as eDNA metabarcoding could help to alleviate this problem. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using an eDNA approach to survey dung beetles, adapting existing monitoring methods for surveying dung fauna to enable eDNA collection in a non-destructive way. The main design idea is to capture species secretions and excretions from a serum-soaked nonwoven compress in a baited non-destructive trap. While the attractiveness of the device to dung beetles and the sampling protocol would benefit from further development, eDNA allowed the identification of more than 68\% of trapped species and an identification of relative abundance match rate of 79\%. The results of the study demonstrate the effectiveness of eDNA-based detection tools for the monitoring of dung beetles compared to standard surveying and identification techniques. Moreover, the adapted collecting device developed for the study could be used for similar surveys of other terrestrial invertebrates or even re-adapted. Ultimately, we hope this study encourages more non-invasive studies of insects by enabling others to utilize these emerging, non-destructive molecular techniques and therefore foster wide insect monitorings and conservation programs.},

We tested the potential for UV-fluorescent and non-fluorescent coloured glitters to be used as markers for tracing the origin of dung incorporated into brood balls (dung shaped by parental beetles enclosing an egg), and so aid in a more complete understanding of resource use in dung beetles. We tested the effect of glitter addition on brood ball production in two species of tunnelling dung beetles, Onthophagus taurus and Euoniticellus fulvus. There was no effect of glitter addition on brood ball production during no-choice tests for each species: both species made a similar number of brood balls, regardless of glitter presence or glitter colour. In a separate choice trial, O. taurus showed no preference for dung when presented with four dung pats containing four unique glitter colours. Here we show that glitter can be used as an effective marker of individual brood ball origin in tunnelling dung beetles. This method provides a useful tool for tracking below ground resource use and larval provisioning experiments in dung beetles.},

Understanding the dispersal process is of great interest in ecology because it is related to several mechanisms driving community structure. We investigated the mobility of dung beetles using mark-release-recapture technique, and tested the usefulness of the current recommendation for interaction distance between baited pitfall traps in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We found differences in mean movement rate between Scarabaeinae species, and between species with different sets of ecological traits. Large-diurnal-tunneler species showed greater mobility than did both large-nocturnal tunneler and roller species. Our results suggest that, based on the analyses of the whole community or the species with the highest number of recaptured individuals, the minimum distance of 50 m between pairs of baited pitfall traps proposed roughly 10 years ago is inadequate. Dung beetle species with different sets of ecological traits may differ in their dispersal ability, so we suggest a new minimum distance of 100 m between pairs of traps to minimize interference between baited pitfall traps for sampling copronecrophagous Scarabaeinae dung beetles.},

The last two decades have seen phenomenal growth in capabilities for high-resolution remote sensing that increasingly offers opportunities to study small, but ecologically important organisms, such as insects. Here we review current applications for using remote sensing within entomological research, highlighting the emerging opportunities that now arise through advances in spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. Remote sensing can be used to map environmental variables, such as habitat, microclimate and light pollution, capturing data on topography, vegetation structure and composition, and luminosity at spatial scales appropriate to insects. Such data can also be used to detect insects indirectly from the influences that they have on the environment, such as feeding damage or nest structures, whilst opportunities for directly detecting insects are also increasingly available. Entomological radar and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), for example, are transforming our understanding of aerial insect abundance and movement ecology, whilst ultra-high spatial resolution drone imagery presents tantalising new opportunities for direct observation. Remote sensing is rapidly developing into a powerful toolkit for entomologists, that we envisage will soon become an integral part of insect science.},

	abstract = {Insect pollinators such as bumblebees play a vital role in many ecosystems, so it is important to understand their foraging movements on a landscape scale. We used harmonic radar to record the natural foraging behaviour of Bombus terrestris audax workers over their entire foraging career. Every flight ever made outside the nest by four foragers was recorded. Our data reveal where the bees flew and how their behaviour changed with experience, at an unprecedented level of detail. We identified how each bee’s flights fit into two categories—which we named exploration and exploitation flights—examining the differences between the two types of flight and how their occurrence changed over the course of the bees’ foraging careers. Exploitation of learned resources takes place during efficient, straight trips, usually to a single foraging location, and is seldom combined with exploration of other areas. Exploration of the landscape typically occurs in the first few flights made by each bee, but our data show that further exploration flights can be made throughout the bee’s foraging career. Bees showed striking levels of variation in how they explored their environment, their fidelity to particular patches, ratio of exploration to exploitation, duration and frequency of their foraging bouts. One bee developed a straight route to a forage patch within four flights and followed this route exclusively for six days before abandoning it entirely for a closer location; this second location had not been visited since her first exploratory flight nine days prior. Another bee made only rare exploitation flights and continued to explore widely throughout its life; two other bees showed more frequent switches between exploration and exploitation. Our data shed light on the way bumblebees balance exploration of the environment with exploitation of resources and reveal extreme levels of variation between individuals.},

              The dispersal of animals from their birth place has profound effects on the immediate survival and longer-term persistence of populations. Molecular studies have estimated that bumblebee colonies can be established many kilometers from their queens’ natal nest site. However, little is known about when and how queens disperse during their lifespan. One possible life stage when dispersal may occur, is directly after emerging from hibernation. Here, harmonic radar tracking of artificially over-wintered
              Bombus terrestris
              queens shows that they spend most of their time resting on the ground with intermittent very short flights (duration and distance). We corroborate these behaviors with observations of wild queen bees, which show similar prolonged resting periods between short flights, indicating that the behavior of our radar-monitored bees was not due to the attachment of transponders nor an artifact of the bees being commercially reared. Radar-monitored flights were not continuously directed away from the origin, suggesting that bees were not intentionally trying to disperse from their artificial emergence site. Flights did not loop back to the origin suggesting bees were not trying to remember or get back to the original release site. Most individuals dispersed from the range of the harmonic radar within less than two days and did not return. Flight directions were not different from a uniform distribution and flight lengths followed an exponential distribution, both suggesting random dispersal. A random walk model based on our observed data estimates a positive net dispersal from the origin over many flights, indicating a biased random dispersal, and estimates the net displacement of queens to be within the range of those estimated in genetic studies. We suggest that a distinct post-hibernation life history stage consisting mostly of rest with intermittent short flights and infrequent foraging fulfils the dual purpose of ovary development and dispersal prior to nest searching.},

              1.
               Bumble bees play a vital role in the pollination of many crops and wild flowers, and plans for their conservation require a knowledge of the dynamics and spatial scale of their foraging flights, which are, at present, poorly understood.
            
            
              2.
               We investigated the foraging range and constancy of two colonies of bumble bees
              Bombus terrestris
              L. on a mixed arable farm using harmonic radar, which has a unique capability to record the trajectories of insects flying at low altitude in the field.
            
            
              3.
               Foraging bees were fitted with lightweight radar transponders and tracked as they flew to and from the nest to forage. The resulting tracks gave information on length, direction and straightness of foraging routes. Superimposition onto a map of the foraging landscape allowed interpretation of the bees’ destinations in relation to the spatial distribution of forage.
            
            
              4.
               Outward tracks had a mean length of 275·3 ± 18·5 m (
              n
               = 65) and a range of 70–631 m, and were often to forage destinations beyond the nearest available forage. Most bees were constant to compass bearing and destination over successive trips, although one bee was tracked apparently switching between forage patches. Both outward and return tracks had a mean straightness ratio of 0·93 ± 0·01 (
              n
               = 99). The bees’ ground speeds ranged from 3·0 m s
              –1
              to 15·7 m s
              –1
              (
              n
               = 100) in a variety of wind conditions.
            
            
              5.
               The results support the hypothesis that bumble bees do not necessarily forage close to their nest, and illustrate that studies on a landscape scale are required if we are to evaluate bee foraging ranges fully with respect to resource availability. Such evaluations are required to underpin assessments of gene flow in bee‐pollinated crops and wild flowers. They are also required when making decisions about the management of bees as pollinators and the conservation of bee and plant biodiversity.},

In a landscape devoid of skyline cues but with a rectangular grid of pathways and roads, we used harmonic radar to track free-flying bumble bees, Bombus terrestris. Individual bees consistently used ground level linear features for navigation in a wide range of behavioural contexts. Bee exploration flights, search behaviour and foraging routes were shaped by linear features, with bees frequently flying along and parallel to pathways and roads. Comparisons of flight trajectories across these behavioural contexts show that individuals modulated their use of linear features strategically with respect to their individual goals and experience. Bees searching for a feeder used linear features to target their search, while foragers often followed pathways to return to their hive without overshooting. These findings on a major pollinator have important implications for the placements of bee colonies for agriculture and floral resources for conservation.},

Movement paths of three butterfly species were measured in large (1.64 ha) experimental patches of open habitat, some of which were connected by corridors. Butterflies that “reflected” off boundaries between open patches and the surrounding forest also emigrated from patches through corridors at rates higher than expected from random movement. This was observed for two open‐habitat species, Eurema nicippe and Phoebis sennae; however, edges and corridors had no effect on a habitat generalist, Papilio troilus. Behaviorally based simulation models, which departed from correlated random walks only at habitat boundaries, predicted that corridors increase interpatch movement rates of both open‐habitat species. Models also predicted that corridors have proportionately greater effects as corridor width increases, that movement rates increase before leveling off as corridor width increases, and that corridor effects decrease as patch size increases. This study suggests that corridors direct movements of habitat‐restricted species and that local behaviors may be used to predict the conservation potential of corridors in fragmented landscapes.},

In the last 35 years, 81 complete revisions and 69 supplements have been produced by 86 authors based in 15 countries, addressing the taxonomic status of 950 species. This is what we christen as the Taxonomic Revolution of New World dung beetles. We review the history and products of this revolution, explore its causes and its apparent exceptionalism among most other New World Coleoptera groups, and point to the many great challenges that still face the scarabaeine taxonomists. An aspect of interest to ecologists is the coevolution of the Taxonomic Revolution with what we call the Ecological Revolution of dung beetles, i.e., the similar expansion in ecological studies about these organisms.

	abstract = {Temperature varies on multiple timescales and ectotherms must adjust to these changes to survive. These adjustments may lead to energetic trade-offs between self-maintenance and reproductive investment. However, we know little about how diurnal and seasonal temperature changes impact energy allocation. Here we used a combination of empirical data and modeling of both thermoregulatory behaviors and body temperature to examine potential energetic trade-offs in the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus. Beginning in March 2020, universities and laboratories were officially closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We thus performed experiments at a private residence near Knoxville, Tennessee, USA, leveraging the heating, ventilation and air conditioning of the home to manipulate temperature and compare beetle responses to stable indoor temperatures versus variable outdoor temperatures. We collected O. taurus beetles in the early-, mid-, and late-breeding seasons to examine energetics and reproductive output in relation to diurnal and seasonal temperature fluctuations. We recorded the mass of field fresh beetles before and after a 24-h fast and used the resulting change in mass as a proxy for energetic costs of self-maintenance across seasons. To understand the impacts of diurnal fluctuations on energy allocation, we held beetles either indoors or outdoors for 14-day acclimation trials, fed them cow dung, and recorded mass change and reproductive output. Utilizing biophysical models, we integrated individual-level biophysical characteristics, microhabitat-specific performance, respirometry data, and thermoregulatory behaviors to predict temperature-induced changes to the allocation of energy toward survival and reproduction. During 24 h of outdoor fasting, we found that beetles experiencing reduced temperature variation lost more mass than those experiencing greater temperature variation, and this was not affected by season. By contrast, during the 14-day acclimation trials, we found that beetles experiencing reduced temperature variation (i.e., indoors) gained more mass than those experiencing greater temperature variation (i.e., outdoors). This effect may have been driven by shifts in the metabolism of the beetles during acclimation to increased temperature variation. Despite the negative relationship between temperature variation and energetic reserves, the only significant predictor of reproductive output was mean temperature. Taken together, we find that diurnal temperature fluctuations are important for driving energetics, but not reproductive output.},

We applied this procedure to the temperature data and the most comprehensive Iberian dataset of dung beetle occurrences as an illustrative example. To understand how populations of different species are responding, we devised a procedure that compares the temporal trend of spatial and temperature variables at the locations and times of all the occurrence data collection (overall trend) with the specific temporal trends among the occurrences of each species. The prevalence of various species responses is linked to life history or taxonomic characteristics, enabling the identification of key factors influencing the propensity to experience different effects from climate change. Our findings suggest that nearly half of the Iberian dung beetle species may be adversely affected by temperature increases, with a geographic shift being the most common response. The results generated through the proposed methodology should be regarded as preliminary information, serving to formulate hypotheses about the diverse responses of species to climate change and aiding in the selection of candidate species capable of coping with challenges posed by changing temperatures.},

In this study, we use circular statistics to examine the seasonal plasticity of 32 dung beetle species in 17 localities of a mountain Iberian assemblage. We assume that the high variability between localities in the seasonal patterns for the same species suggests that seasonal plasticity could minimise the demographic effects of climate change on local populations. 3. Our results suggest that the populations of at least one-third of the dung beetle species could partially adapt to the effects of climate change by modifying their phenological occurrence, and that the degree of concentration of the seasonal occurrences is generally maintained independently of the locality. However, we have not detected clear seasonal pattern variations or a clear effect of environmental temperature on seasonal variations in around two-thirds of the studied species. 4. The dung beetle assemblages of this mountain region will experience deep changes in the future. Plasticity in seasonal patterns does not seem to be associated with species characteristics such as high-rank taxonomic identity, body weight, or geographical distribution. Only the general functional character of species would have some explanatory power. Endophagic Aphodiidae dung beetle species would be more capable than hypophagic species in mitigating the effects of climate change by modifying their phenological traits, whereas that Scarabaeidae hypophagic species may cope better with these climatic changes without having to change their seasonal activities.},

	abstract = {Background Dung beetles provide many important ecosystem services, including dung decomposition, pathogen control, soil aeration, and secondary seed dispersal. Yet, the biology of most dung beetles remains unknown. Natural diets are poorly studied, partly because previous research has focused on choice or attraction experiments using few, easily accessible dung types from zoo animals, farm animals, or humans. This way, many links within natural food webs have certainly been missed. In this work, we aimed to establish a protocol to analyze the natural diets of dung beetles using DNA gut barcoding. Methods First, the feasibility of gut-content DNA extraction and amplification of 12s rDNA from six different mammal dung types was tested in the laboratory. We then applied the method to beetles caught in pitfall traps in Ecuador and Germany by using 12s rDNA primers. For a subset of the dung beetles caught in the Ecuador sampling, we also used 16s rDNA primers to see if these would improve the number of species we could identify. We predicted the likelihood of amplifying DNA using gut fullness, DNA concentration, PCR primer, collection method, and beetle species as predictor variables in a dominance analysis. Based on the gut barcodes, we generated a dung beetle-mammal network for both field sites (Ecuador and Germany) and analyzed the levels of network specificity. Results We successfully amplified mammal DNA from dung beetle gut contents for 128 specimens, which included such prominent species as Panthera onca (jaguar) and Puma concolor (puma). The overall success rate of DNA amplification was 53\%. The best predictors for amplification success were gut fullness and DNA concentration, suggesting the success rate can be increased by focusing on beetles with a full gut. The mammal dung–dung beetle networks differed from purely random network models and showed a moderate degree of network specialization (H2′: Ecuador = 0.49; Germany = 0.41). Conclusion We here present a reliable method of extracting and amplifying gut-content DNA from dung beetles. Identifying mammal dung via DNA reference libraries, we created mammal dung-dung beetle trophic networks. This has benefits over previous methods because we inventoried the natural mammal dung resources of dung beetles instead of using artificial mammal baits. Our results revealed higher levels of specialization than expected and more rodent DNA than expected in Germany, suggesting that the presented method provides more detailed insights into mammal dung–dung beetle networks. In addition, the method could have applications for mammal monitoring in many ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The seasonal and diel variations of dung beetle species were studied in an Iberian mid-mountain locality to examine the interaction between these two temporal rhythms. We assume that a seasonal variation in the diel activity would support the notion that both rhythms may assist in achieving a quick and flexible response when the climatic conditions change. Data coming from 4,104 pitfall traps placed during 15 sampling periods and totalling 30 daily sampling cycles were analysed using circular statistics and General Linear Models. A wide variety of seasonal patterns are observed, highlighting those species with a clear unimodal or spring-autumn bimodal seasonal pattern. However, a midday diel pattern is the norm in most of the species, except in the case of those exhibiting a high body weight that prefer dusk or night periods. We hypothesize that most of the dung beetle species fly at noon to promote the passive heating of their muscle activity and minimize the metabolic energy expenditure. Results only partially support the seasonal variation in diel activity. Diel preferences are mainly manifested at the time of the year in which the abundance is greater. Approximately two-thirds of the considered species exhibit a similar diel activity along their seasonal active period. As consequence, a significant portion of the dung beetle species currently inhabiting Mediterranean mid-mountains are not able to use the daily variation in climatic conditions to limit the inconveniences of climate change.},

	abstract = {In terrestrial ecosystems, insects face a wide range of temperatures among habitats and time; consequently, the thermal niche is one of the main determinants of habitat selection and temporal patterns of activity. The replacement of native forests changes micro-climatic conditions and reduces the diversity of dung beetles; however, the physiological mechanisms behind these changes are not clear. We explore the role of the thermal niche in dung beetles to explain the ability of native species to exploit human-created habitats. Using infrared thermography, we measured variables associated with the thermal niche in 17 native species and used linear mixed-effects model and ANOVAs to compare disturbed habitats and the native forest. Endothermy and body mass explained the ability of dung beetles to exploit human-created open habitats. Small and diurnal species with very low endothermy were able to exploit deforested open habitats; evening/nocturnal/crepuscular species showed similar body mass and high endothermy in all habitats. Regarding thermoregulation mechanisms, none of the species (except one) showed defined or efficient mechanisms of physiological thermoregulation. In view of the accelerated process of forest replacement and climate change, a more profound understanding of the physiological requirements of species is essential to predict and mitigate future extinctions.},

Light pollution can have detrimental effects on behavior,3–5 including by disrupting the journeys of migratory birds,5,6 sand hoppers,7–9 and moths.10 This is particularly concerning, since many night-active species rely on compass information in the sky, including the moon,11,12 the skylight polarization pattern,13,14 and the stars,15 to hold their course. Even animals not directly exposed to streetlights and illuminated buildings may still experience indirect light pollution in the form of skyglow,3,4 which can extend far beyond urban areas.1,2 While some recent research used simulated light pollution to estimate how skyglow may affect orientation behavior,7–9 the consequences of authentic light pollution for celestial orientation have so far been neglected. Here, we present the results of behavioral experiments at light-polluted and dark-sky sites paired with photographic measurements of each environment. We ﬁnd that light pollution obscures natural celestial cues and induces dramatic changes in dung beetle orientation behavior, forcing them to rely on bright earthbound beacons in place of their celestial compass. This change in behavior results in attraction toward artiﬁcial lights, thereby increasing inter-individual competition and reducing dispersal efﬁciency. For the many other species of insect, bird, and mammal that rely on the night sky for orientation and migration, these effects could dramatically hinder their vital night-time journeys.},

	abstract = {Traits are key for understanding the environmental responses and ecological roles of organisms. Trait approaches to functional ecology are well established for plants, whereas consistent frameworks for animal groups are less developed. Here we suggest a framework for the study of the functional ecology of animals from a trait-based response–effect approach, using dung beetles as model system. Dung beetles are a key group of decomposers that are important for many ecosystem processes. The lack of a trait-based framework tailored to this group has limited the use of traits in dung beetle functional ecology. We review which dung beetle traits respond to the environment and affect ecosystem processes, covering the wide range of spatial, temporal and biological scales at which they are involved. Dung beetles show trait-based responses to variation in temperature, water, soil properties, trophic resources, light, vegetation structure, competition, predation and parasitism. Dung beetles' influence on ecosystem processes includes trait-mediated effects on nutrient cycling, bioturbation, plant growth, seed dispersal, other dung-based organisms and parasite transmission, as well as some cases of pollination and predation. We identify 66 dung beetle traits that are either response or effect traits, or both, pertaining to six main categories: morphology, feeding, reproduction, physiology, activity and movement. Several traits pertain to more than one category, in particular dung relocation behaviour during nesting or feeding. We also identify 136 trait–response and 77 trait–effect relationships in dung beetles. No response to environmental stressors nor effect over ecological processes were related with traits of a single category. This highlights the interrelationship between the traits shaping body-plans, the multi-functionality of traits, and their role linking responses to the environment and effects on the ecosystem. Despite current developments in dung beetle functional ecology, many knowledge gaps remain, and there are biases towards certain traits, functions, taxonomic groups and regions. Our framework provides the foundations for the thorough development of trait-based dung beetle ecology. It also serves as an example framework for other taxa.},

	abstract = {The role of deterministic and stochastic mechanisms in community assembly is a key question in ecology, but little is known about their relative contribution in dung beetle assemblages. Moreover, in human modified landscapes these mechanisms are crucial to understand how biodiversity can be maintained in productive agroecosystems. We explored the assembly mechanisms driving dung beetle assemblages in forests and grazed grassland patches, and assessed the role of dung availability, soil hardness and moisture, elevation and land use heterogeneity as environmental predictors of functional diversity. To determine the underlying assembly mechanisms, we estimated functional diversity metrics (functional richness, evenness and divergence) and their departure from the predicted values by null models. We also used GLMs to assess the influence of environmental variables on functional diversity. In most cases, stochastic processes prevailed in structuring dung beetle assemblages and, consequently, environmental variables were not good predictors of dung beetle functional diversity. However, limiting similarity was found as a secondary mechanism with an effect on dung beetle assemblages in grasslands. Our results highlight the importance of stochastic processes that may reflect a metacommunity dynamic. Therefore, restoring landscape connectivity might be more important than habitat quality for the conservation of these functionally diverse beetle assemblages.},

Most research focusing on decomposition-related ecosystem functioning has focused on dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) while other insects, particularly flies, have received comparatively less attention. 3. Using mesocosms, this study manipulated the insect groups colonising cow dung (beetles only, flies only, beetles and flies together, and an insect-free control). Half of the insects were exposed to 1 mg kg−1 ivermectin in dung, while the other half were exposed to ivermectin-free dung. Dung decomposition (mass of organic matter lost) and dung removal (change in the dry mass of the dung pat attributed to both dung decomposition and burial) were measured. 4. Comparison of beetles and flies in ivermectin-free dung showed that beetles removed nearly twice as much dung as did flies. Comparison of dung removal across all treatments showed that ivermectin residues significantly reduced dung removal provided by beetles by 47\% and dung removal provided by beetles and flies together by 32\%. 5. Organic matter decomposition was not significantly affected by insect colonists or by the presence of ivermectin, indicating that organic matter decomposition can occur independently of insect activity and chemical perturbations.},

This study is a contribution to this discourse by elucidating the linkages between climate, land use, biodiversity, body size and ecosystem functions. We disentangled direct climatic from biodiversity-mediated effects by using dung removal by dung beetles as a model system and by combining correlative field data and exclosure experiments along an extensive elevational gradient on Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Dung removal declined with increasing elevation, being associated with a strong reduction in the richness and body size traits of dung beetle communities. Climate influenced dung removal rates by modifying biodiversity rather than by direct effects. The biodiversity–ecosystem effect was driven by a change in the mean body size of dung beetles. Dung removal rates were strongly reduced when large dung beetles were experimentally excluded. This study underscores that climate influences ecosystem functions mainly by modifying biodiversity and underpins the important role of body size for dung removal.},

In particular, the exclusion of key functional groups through habitat disturbance may lead to the breakdown of ecosystem functions. Dung removal is an important process contributing to nutrient cycling and thus productivity in grazed ecosystems. 2. This study investigated the role of different functional groups of dung beetles in dung removal in different habitats within a wood-pasture in two different seasons. An experimental setting with 12 blocks and 108 dung pads was used to investigate short-term dung removal over 1 week of exposure. 3. Dung removal was most strongly affected by habitat type, with almost 40\% lower levels in grassland than in adjacent forest and forest gaps. Of all assemblage characteristics, total biomass of tunneller species was the strongest predictor of dung removal, whereas functional diversity showed no significant effect. In accordance with the dung removal pattern at habitat type level, densities of large tunnellers were suppressed in grassland compared with forest. 4. It is concluded that dung removal is habitat-specific and large tunnellers play a disproportionate role in this important ecosystem function in temperate forests.},

	abstract = {Trophic ecology of dung beetles has been widely studied because of the important ecological role of these taxa. However, previous studies have focused on a limited number of potential food items (mainly vertebrate dung and carrion) and have used only one approach (either field or laboratory). Moreover, recent studies showed high abundance of dung beetles in defaunated areas with a low abundance of these resources. In this study, we combined a field and laboratory approach to explore dung beetle trophic attraction to different potential native resources in the Atlantic forest; and we evaluated whether results can explain the high abundance of dung beetles in defaunated areas. Through laboratory olfactometry experiments, we first exposed individuals to vertebrate carrion, omnivorous dung, and decomposing fungi. Then, we exposed species that exhibited a preference for dung to monkey, tapir, and feline dung; and those that preferred carrion and decomposing fungi to chicken, cow meat, and arthropod carcasses. We compared trophic attractions in the field and laboratory conditions with generalised additive models. We found that coprophagous species preferred monkey dung, and all necrophagous and sapro-necrophagous species preferred arthropod carcasses. These results suggest that the importance of arthropods carcasses as an important resource for dung beetles has been largely underestimated. The results of this study might provide an explanation for the high abundance of necrophagous and sapro-necrophagous dung beetles in defaunated areas. In addition, the use of omnivorous dung and arthropod carcasses could be an effective sampling method for dung beetle assemblages.},

Dung beetles are the primary group of insects responsible for dung turnover, and factors affecting their abundance and distribution thus impact dung degradation. Lands lost to grazing due to dung buildup and pasture contamination total millions of acres per year in US pastures. We evaluated the structural differences in dung beetle assemblages in natural grasslands versus a managed agroecosystem in subtropical southeastern Florida (USA). We measured the direct effect of dung longevity when dung beetle fauna normally inhabiting dung pats were excluded. Our results indicate dung beetle abundance, functional diversity, and species richness have a substantial impact on the rate of dung turnover in subtropical pastoral lands with 70\% of dung removed from the soil surface after three months. Functional diversity and evenness did not have a significant positive effect on dung removal in managed, versus natural grasslands demonstrating a strong relationship between dung beetle assemblage composition and delivery of a key ecological process, dung degradation. We suggest the importance of trees, which provide a thermal refuge for beetles, should be dispersed within matrixes of open pasture areas and within proximity to adjacent closed-canopy hammocks to facilitate the exchange of dung beetles between habitats and therefore maintain the provisioning of dung degradation services by dung beetle assemblages.},

In particular, odour cues are often essential for the localization and discrimination of resources with patchy distribution. Dung beetles (Scarabaeoidea) rely on such scented resources to locate food for their own diet and to provision their progeny. Despite the beetles’ mostly generalist choice across dung types, several studies showed that the beetles prefer some dung types over others. Yet, the importance of VOCs for dung localization and differentiation remains unclear. In this study, we used six single chemical components (indole, skatole, phenol, butyric acid, 2-butanone, and p-cresol), two different blends of these components, and six different dung types for a detailed behavioural analysis of dung beetles. We found very little specialization of beetle species towards specific VOCs. We found that dung baits and baits with synthetic compounds attracted similar communities of dung beetles, but the visitors of synthetic baits exhibited much lower diversity and abundance. The analysis of dung scent profiles of six types of dung revealed both, unique patterns in composition and ubiquitous components such as p-cresol. However, when we used a six-component blend of synthetic compounds, it turned out to be as attractive as three of the most attractive dung types in the field. Our findings highlight the significance of key VOCs, but, moreover, that dung beetles use a blend of specific components for resource localization.},

Using climate-controlled chambers, we investigated the potential effects of climate change on the performance of a tunnelling dung beetle, Onthophagus taurus. Over two trials, we exposed beetles to a +0°C, +2°C or +4°C increase in diurnally fluctuating field recorded temperatures and measured survival, pat departure, reproduction (brood number and size) and dung burial by beetles. Temperature treatment did not affect pat departure behaviour. Relative to the control +0°C chambers, beetle survival was higher in the +2°C chambers, but there was no difference in survival between the +0°C and +4°C chambers. In Trial 1, brood number was reduced in both the +2°C and +4°C chambers, relative to the +0°C chambers. In Trial 2, brood number was significantly reduced relative to control chambers in the +2°C chambers only. Temperature did not affect brood size. Across temperature treatments, there was a significant, positive relationship between brood number and dung burial. However, trends in brood production with temperature were not mirrored by dung burial; the only reduction in dung burial was found in the warmest treatment of Trial 2. Our results suggest that initially, warming may not substantially reduce dung burial by O. taurus; however, ecosystem services may be impacted if lower brood production eventually reduces beetle numbers. Studies such as ours identify the vulnerabilities of ecosystem service providers to climate change and in doing so are an essential first step in the management of ecosystem services under future warming.},

However, in the grasslands of the Central Asian dry steppe, the effects of dung beetles on dung removal remain almost unstudied. Here, we examined dung removal by different dung beetle species (Colobterus erraticus (Linnaeus, 1758), Onthophagus bivertex Heyden, 1887, Onthophagus gibbulus (Pallas, 1781), Gymnopleurus mopsus (Pallas, 1781), Cheironitis eumenes Motschulsky, 1859, and Geotrupes koltzei Reitter, 1892), and compared the impacts with control treatments (without beetles) under natural pasture conditions and in the laboratory. We examined the influence of different variables on dung removal rates, such as dung type and dung beetle traits (nesting strategies, abundance, body size, and biomass). We found higher dung removal rates during the initial 48 h in field and laboratory conditions. Among nesting strategies, tunnellers demonstrated significantly higher dung removal rates than dweller and roller species. The highest amount of dung removal was estimated for C. eumenes (6.5 g/day by seven individuals). We found no significant relationship between dung removal rates and dung beetle body size or biomass, but we observed a strong negative correlation between dung beetle abundance and dung removal rates. Our findings highlight the importance of dung type and age, nesting strategies and abundances of dung beetles, and experimental conditions, which are the main factors driving the process of dung removal.},

Aphodius and Sphaeridium) using both dung pads and baited pitfall traps. Wet weight of 22-day-old natural dung pads was found to vary widely in the field ({\textless} 100 g – {\textgreater}1000 g). Across all sampling dates in field experiments, dung pad size had a significant influence on dung beetle biomass sampled from pads. Closer examination of experimental dung pads on the second day after deposition, when beetle biomass was at a maximum, revealed not only a general positive relationship between pad size and dung beetle biomass but, more importantly, a positive relationship between dung pad size and dung beetle density (dung beetle biomass per unit dung volume). There was a strong trend for Aphodius species richness to increase, and maintain higher values for longer periods of time, in larger pads. Although dung pad and pitfall trap samples could differ in the actual numbers of beetles captured, the relationship between different dung sizes and dung beetle biomass was similar, indicating that the phenomenon is largely related to immigration processes. Pat residence times oi A. rufipes in the laboratory were significantly positively correlated with dung pad size. In two field experiments, positive correlations were found between dung pad size and numbers of larvae in pads of different sizes and in one of these experiments, larval densities (numbers per unit dung volume) were significantly and positively correlated with dung pad size. In one experiment, Aphodius larvae in the early stages of development were found to preferentially occupy the basal area of dung pads. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of resource utilisation by north temperate dung beetles.},

	abstract = {At the basis of a trophic web, coprophagous animals like dung beetles (Scarabaeoidea) utilize resources that may have advantages (easy gain and handling) as well as drawbacks (formerly processed food). Several studies have characterized the nutrients, e.g. C/N ratios and organic matter content, for specific types of dung. However, a comparative approach across dung types and feeding guilds of dung producers, and relationships between dung nutrients and preferences by coprophages, have been missing. Hence, we analyzed water content, C/N ratio, amino acid, neutral lipid fatty acid, free fatty acid and sterol composition and concentrations in dung from 23 vertebrates, including carnivore, omnivore and herbivore species. Our analyses revealed significant differences among the three vertebrate feeding guilds for most nutritional parameters. Although formerly processed, dung grants sufficient amounts of essential nutrients for insects. We tested whether nutrients can explain the dung beetles’ preferences in a field experiment, using 12 representative dung types in baits that were installed in 27 forests and 27 grasslands. Although consistent preferences for specific dung types were pronounced, the nutritional composition did not predict the variation in attractiveness of these dung diets, suggesting a primary role of dung volatiles irrespective of food quality.},

	abstract = {1. Insects are sensitive to climate change. Consequently, insect-mediated ecosystem functions and services may be altered by changing climates. 2. Dung beetles provide multiple services by burying manure. Using climate-controlled chambers, the effects of warming on dung burial and reproduction by the dung beetle Sisyphus rubrus Paschalidis, 1974 were investigated. Sisyphus rubrus break up dung by forming and rolling away balls of manure for burial and egg deposition. 3. To simulate warming in the chambers, 0, 2 or 4 °C offsets were added to field-recorded, diurnally fluctuating temperatures. We measured dung ball production and burial, egg laying, survival and residence times of beetles. 4. Temperature did not affect the size or number of dung balls produced; however warming reduced dung ball burial by S. rubrus. Because buried balls were more likely to contain eggs, warming could reduce egg laying via a reduction in ball burial. Warming reduced the humidity inside the chambers, and a positive relationship was found between the number of dung balls produced and humidity in two temperature treatments. Temperature did not affect survival, or whether or not a beetle left a chamber. Beetles that did leave the chambers took longer to do so in the warmest treatment. 5. This study demonstrates that climate warming could reduce reproduction and dung burial by S. rubrus, and is an important first step to understanding warming effects on burial services. Future studies should assess warming effects in field situations, both on individual dung beetle species and on aggregate dung burial services.},

However, the relationship between traits and functions is typically assumed but seldom tested. We analyze the relationship between dung beetle traits and three ecological functions: dung removal, dung burial, and seedling emergence. We set up a laboratory experiment using nine Scarabaeidae species (three endocoprids, four paracoprids, and two telecoprids). We placed a sexual pair of beetles in each experimental unit, together with a mixture of dung and seeds, and measured the amount of dung removed and buried, burial depth, and the number of emerged seedlings. Sixteen morphological traits related to dung removal and burial were measured in each individual. Results indicate that these traits were related to dung beetle performance in dung removal and burial. Most traits were positively related to dung removal, indicating the existence of a general trait syndrome associated with dung manipulation and digging capability. Dung exploitation strategies did not provide further explanatory power. Seedling emergence showed a negative but weak relationship with dung burial amount and depth and species identity. This implies that specific differences in dung–soil interface activity may be important in secondary seed dispersal by dung beetles.},

Dung beetles bury dung for feeding and breeding, and it is generally thought that the process of burying dung increases nutrient uptake by plant roots, which promotes plant growth. Many studies have tested the effects of dung beetles on plant growth, but there has been no quantitative synthesis of these studies. Here we use a multi-level meta-analysis to estimate the average effect of dung beetles on plant growth and investigate factors that moderate this effect. We identified 28 publications that investigated dung beetle effects on plant growth. Of these, 24 contained the minimum quantitative data necessary to include in a meta-analysis. Overall, we found that dung beetles increased plant growth by 17\%; the 95\% CI for possible values for the true increase in plant growth that were most compatible with our data, given our statistical model, ranged from 1\% to 35\%. We found evidence that the dung beetle–plant growth relationship is influenced by the plant measurement type and the number of beetles accessing the dung. However, beetles did not increase plant growth in all quantitative trials, as individual effect sizes ranged from −72\% to 806\%, suggesting important context-dependence in the provision of ecosystem services.},

The effects of coprophagous insects on decomposition of cow dung were studied in microcosm of cow dung. Five treatments of insects were used in one experiment (no insects, fly larvae, scarabaeid beetles, hydrophilid beetles, and normal insect colonization) and 3 treatments in a second experiment (no insects, low population density of scarabaeid beetles, and high beetle density). Microcosms were monitored for 63 days (experiment 1) and 48 days (experiment 2). Moisture content, redox potential (Eh) and carbon content of dung were analysed in these experiments. Insect activity was associated with accelerated rates of drying and oxidation in dung. Burrowing and tunnelling by these organisms opened the center of the pat which produced desiccation. Oxidation of dung occurred as a result of this drying; Eh was significantly correlated with moisture consent. Carbon flux in dung was limited, which demonstrated that decomposition was slow. This result is attributable to initiai conditions of anasroWpsis and subsequent rapid desiccation. Insect activity was associated with decreased carbon in dung; density and biomass of Aphodius beetles was negatively correlated with carbon content. These results are compared to preeous studies on cow dung decomposition.},

These experiments did not examine naturally occurring dung pats, but used experimental dung pats to examine the ability of north temperate dung beetles to discriminate among different dung types. A small number of laboratory experiments investigated pat residence times (PRT) and larval production across different dung types. There were significant differences in the biomass and abundance of dung beetle colonisation across different dung types. Sheep dung tended to have highest abundances of beetles, but there was evidence of species-specific differences in dung beetle colonisation of the different kinds of dung. In two out of three comparisons, laboratory experiments provided evidence that adult PRT were significantly different among different kinds of dung. In each of three laboratory experiments, larval production was significantly higher in sheep than cow dung pats of the same size.

Dung beetles are well known for their functions in breaking down and transporting ungulate dung into soils thus promoting dung decomposition. However, the effects of functionally different dung beetles on the decomposition processes of the dung from different ungulates remain less explored. We did an in situ experiment using the 'dung and soil' mesocosm to investigate the separate and combined effects of two functionally contrasting dung beetle species, a dweller Aphodius sordecens and a tunneler Onthophagus gibbulus, on the decomposition processes of the dung from horse and cattle. We determined the changes in dung mass, dung C and N contents, microbial respiration from the 'dung and soil' mesocosm or from the soil beneath the dung pats, and examined the amount of dung balls transferred by beetles into different soil layers, under five dung beetle treatments (C – soil, no dung nor beetles; D – dung on soil with no beetles; DB - dung on soil with dweller beetles; TB - dung on soil with tunneler beetles; DTB - dung on soil with dweller and tunneler beetles) were applied to the dung of two major grazers with different digestive systems in native steppes in northern China, over a two-month period following dung deposition. We found that (1) tunneler beetles (in TB and DTB) significantly enhanced the dry mass loss of cattle dung but not horse dung. (2) Dung C and N contents declined more rapidly with the presence of any dung beetle species (DB-DTB) than that without (D); and dung N content showed different decreasing rates between horse and cattle dung in different decomposition periods. (3) The presence of the two functionally contrasting dung beetle species together had a synergistic, positive effect on soil microbial respiration and thus on the decomposition rate of soil organic matter; however, no significant effects of beetles on net microbial respiration was detected in the 'dung + soil' mesocosm. (4) The direct effect of dung beetles on dung mass loss was stronger for cattle dung than for horse dung. In contrast, the decline in moisture content of horse dung with decomposition time affected the microbial respiration in dung, and thus indirectly affected the dry mass loss and the C and N contents. Our results suggest it critically important to incorporate the functions of soil invertebrates into nutrient cycling models to improve their accuracy, and to promote invertebrate diversity in grazed grassland to maintain ecosystem health and services.},

The diversity of a three-species community (dung beetles, dung flies and epigeic earthworms) was systematically manipulated to produce different relative abundance distributions (evenness levels) and the resulting communities were introduced to standardised dung pats in laboratory experiments. Dung decomposition was modelled using an analysis that disentangled species identity effects and the interactions among species that contribute to the diversity effect. This revealed that the net diversity effect was composed of positive (fly–earthworm), negative (beetle–earthworm) and neutral (fly–beetle) effects of species interaction. These pairwise interactions resulted in complex, but systematically varying and predictable effects on dung decomposition as the relative abundances of species changed. Decomposition was consistently greater in communities with higher decomposer biomass. The utility of the adopted analytical approach was emphasised by comparison with an ANOVA that found that dung decomposition did not differ among evenness levels. Thus, the averaging of decomposition across different community structures within evenness levels masked the different effects of species interactions.

The coprine species Catharsius tricornutus and Copris elphenor are large fast burying paracoprids and a pair will bury one dung mass (100-300 g) within 24-48 hours of pad colonization. The onitine Onitis alexis is a large slow burying species that buries dung continuously over many days (400-1000 g) following pad colonization. (2) Parallel field and laboratory experiments were conducted using single or coprine/Onitis mixed-species density combinations ranging from one to sixteen pairs per 1.5 kg dung pads. Dung burial by each species was assessed 4 days after pad colonization. (3) Results from field and laboratory experiments were very similar. Strong intraspecific competition for dung was shown by all species at densities greater than two to four pairs per pad. At high densities 70-80\% of each pad was removed. O. alexis sequestered all buried dung as a brood mass under the pad, and intraspecific competition led to a reduction in the amount of dung buried per pair. As the density of coprine beetles increased and intraspecific competition intensified, increasing proportions of the dung pad were utilized, but decreasing proportions were converted to buried dung. (4) Strong asymmetric competition was demonstrated between the coprine and onitine species. Dung burial by the coprine species was largely unaffected by the presence of onitine beetles, but the amount of dung buried by O. alexis was markedly reduced in the presence of two to three pairs of coprine beetles, i.e. the rapid resource usage by coprine beetles intensified intraspecific competition in onitine beetles. (5) The coprine and onitine species studied are broadly representative of their groups and colonize fresh dung pads (1-2 days old) at dusk. Hence, strong asymmetric competition (resource pre-emption) is to be expected where members of the two groups occur together. The potential consequences of this for the relative abundance of dung beetle species and hence community organization are considered.},

Dwellers were the most diverse and abundant group, but tunnelers were dominant in terms of biomass. All dung beetle functional groups had a clear preference for fresh dung. The ecosystem services in dung removal and secondary seed dispersal provided by dung beetles were significant and differed between functional groups. Although in absolute numbers more dwellers were found, large tunnelers were disproportionally important for dung burial and seed removal. In the absence of dung beetles, other soil inhabiting fauna, such as earthworms, partly took over the dung decomposing role of dung beetles while most dung was processed when all native functional groups were present. Our results, therefore, emphasize the need to conserve functionally complete dung ecosystems to maintain full ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {Two field experiments were conducted to evaluate effects of dung beetles on cattle dung decomposition, soil nutrients and herbage growth. On an orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) pasture, three treatments, each composed of 1 kg of cattle dung, were placed in a randomized block design. For each treatment, dung beetles of three tunneler species were released at a density of 0, 40 or 80 beetles per dung sample in the 2000 experiment and 0, 40 or 120 beetles per dung sample in the 2001–2002 experiment. The respective weights and nutrient contents in the dung sample remnants were measured for 56 days; nutrients in the soil beneath the dung samples were also measured for the same period in the 2001–2002 experiment. Additionally, herbage yield along with the dung weight and nutrients were measured over 2 years in the 2001–2002 experiment. In both the 2000 and 2001–2002 experiments, the greater the dung beetles released, the greater the decomposition and loss of nutrients from the dung. Inorganic nitrogen (N) in the soil of beetle-released plots increased considerably until the seventh day according to the beetles released. That pattern in the soil reflected the N loss from the dung. Trends of available phosphorus (P) and exchangeable potassium (K) in the soil were not explained so clearly as the case of N. Yield and N and P uptakes of herbage around the dung were significantly larger in the beetle-released plot than in the no-beetle released plot in September of the first year in the 2001–2002 experiment. In other seasons (July 2001 and May, July and September 2002), however, significant relationships between yield and nutrient uptakes of herbage and dung beetle activities were not detected. These results indicate that dung beetles promoted dung decomposition and nutrient transfer from the dung to soil, however, subsequent effects on herbage growth were not clear under field conditions.},

	abstract = {Clear understanding of the links between ecological functions and biodiversity is needed to assess and predict the true environmental consequences of human activities. Several key ecosystem functions are provided by coprophagous beetles in the subfamily Scarabaeinae (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), which feed on animal excreta as both adults and larvae. Through manipulating feces during the feeding process, dung beetles instigate a series of ecosystem functions ranging from secondary seed dispersal to nutrient cycling and parasite suppression. Many of these ecological functions provide valuable ecosystem services such as biological pest control and soil fertilization. Here we summarize the contributions of dung beetles to nutrient cycling, bioturbation, plant growth enhancement, secondary seed dispersal and parasite control, as well as highlight their more limited role in pollination and trophic regulation. We discuss where these ecosystem functions clearly translate into ecosystem services, outline areas in critical need of additional research and describe a research agenda to fill those gaps. Due to the high sensitivity of dung beetles to habitat modification and changing dung resources, many of these ecological processes have already been disrupted or may be affected in the future. Prediction of the functional consequences of dung beetle decline demands functional studies conducted with naturally assembled beetle communities, which broaden the geographic scope of existing work, assess the spatio-temporal distribution of multiple functions, and link these ecosystem processes more clearly to ecosystem services.},

A total of 74,326 scarabaeoid beetles were captured, of which 77.4\% were Aphodiinae (not identified to species). The remaining specimens belong to 104 species in 47 genera and 6 families. The most abundant species were Cyclocephala lurida Bland, Dyscinetus morator (F.), Euetheola humilis (Burmeister), Hybosorus illigeri Reiche, and Maladera castanea (Arrow). In all trap types, \&gt;90\% of all specimens and taxa were collected between April and August. Ultraviolet light traps collected ∼94\% of total specimens consisting of 83 taxa (of which 51 were unique to this trap type), whereas flight-intercept traps captured ∼2\% of all specimens representing 53 taxa (18 of which were unique), and pitfall traps captured ∼4\% of all specimens representing 15 taxa (no unique species; all species also captured by ultraviolet light traps). Indicator species analysis identified 2–3 and 10–13 taxa that were most frequently collected by flight-intercept and ultraviolet light traps, respectively. Flight-intercept traps complemented ultraviolet light traps by capturing more species of dung and carrion beetles and diurnal phytophagous scarab beetles. Results suggested that a similar survey for domestic or exotic scarabaeoid beetles in turfgrass systems should be conducted between April and August using ultraviolet light and flight-intercept traps at 13–58 sites.},

Pitfall traps baited with human feces were buried to soil level in plantations and surrounding forests. Fifty traps were used in each type of vegetation, placed at 50 m intervals along five transects. Dung beetle communities in oil palm plantations have lower species richness (18 spp.) than in surrounding tropical rainforest (48 spp.), as well as altered species composition. Total abundance of individuals was not significantly different between the two habitats, but species composition was greatly different. Species evenness was greater in the forest. Forest corridors for the preservation of dung beetle species may need to be much wider than current designs. The erosion of biodiversity in dung beetles due to oil palm monoculture parallels what has been seen in other animal taxa in tropical tree plantations.},

	abstract = {For this article, I reviewed empirical studies finding significant ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se—in other words, significant responses to fragmentation independent of the effects of habitat amount (hereafter referred to as habitat fragmentation). I asked these two questions: Are most significant responses to habitat fragmentation negative or positive? And do particular attributes of species or landscapes lead to a predominance of negative or positive significant responses? I found 118 studies reporting 381 significant responses to habitat fragmentation independent of habitat amount. Of these responses, 76\% were positive. Most significant fragmentation effects were positive, irrespective of how the authors controlled for habitat amount, the measure of fragmentation, the taxonomic group, the type of response variable, or the degree of specialization or conservation status of the species or species group. No support was found for predictions that most significant responses to fragmentation should be negative in the tropics, for species with larger movement ranges, or when habitat amount is low; most significant fragmentation effects were positive in all of these cases. Thus, although 24\% of significant responses to habitat fragmentation were negative, I found no conditions in which most responses were negative. Authors suggest a wide range of possible explanations for significant positive responses to habitat fragmentation: increased functional connectivity, habitat diversity, positive edge effects, stability of predator–prey/host–parasitoid systems, reduced competition, spreading of risk, and landscape complementation. A consistent preponderance of positive significant responses to fragmentation implies that there is no justification for assigning lower conservation value to a small patch than to an equivalent area within a large patch—instead, it implies just the opposite. This finding also suggests that land sharing will usually provide higher ecological value than land sparing.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss is a major threat to biodiversity, but the effects of habitat fragmentation are less clear. Examining drivers of key demographic processes, such as reproduction, will clarify species-level responses to fragmentation and broader effects on biodiversity. Yet, understanding how fragmentation affects demography has been challenging due to the many ways landscapes are altered by co-occurring habitat loss and fragmentation, coupled with the rarity of experiments to disentangle these effects. In a large, replicated fragmentation experiment with open savanna habitats surrounded by pine plantation forests, we tested the effects of inter-patch connectivity, patch edge-to-area ratio, and within-patch distance from an edge on plant reproductive output. Using five experimentally planted species of restoration interest—three wind-pollinated grass species and two insect-pollinated forb species—we measured plant flowering, pollination rate, and seed production. All plant species were more likely to flower and produce more flowering structures farther from the forest edge. Connectivity and distance from an edge, however, had no effect on the pollination rate (regardless of pollination mode). Despite no influence of fragmentation on pollination, plant seed production increased farther from the edge for four of five species, driven by the increase in flower production. Synthesis. Altogether, we demonstrate that plant reproductive output (seed production) is decreased by habitat fragmentation through edge effects on flowering. Our work provides evidence that an important contributor to plant demography, reproductive output, is altered by edge effects in fragmented patches. These species-level impacts of fragmentation may provide insight into the mechanisms of fragmentation effects on community-level changes in biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Estimating the number of species in a community is important for assessments of biodiversity. Previous species richness estimators are mainly based on nonparametric approaches. Although parametric asymptotic models have been applied, they received limited attention due to specific limitations. Here, we introduce parametric models fitting the probability-based rarefied species richness curve that allow us to estimate the “Total Expected Species” (TES) in a community based on species' abundance data. We develop two approaches to calculate TES (termed “TESa” and “TESb”), based on two slightly different mathematical assumptions regarding Expected Species (ES) models. We provide R functions to calculate both these estimation approaches and their standard deviation. The function also enables users to visualize the estimation. We test the performance of TESa, TESb, and their average (TESab) across simulated and empirical data, and compare their bias, precision, and accuracy with other commonly used, nonparametric species richness estimators: the bias-corrected (bc-)Chao1 and the abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE). Simulation reveals that in small samples TESa shows a tendency to overestimate and TESb to underestimate overall species richness. TESab performs well in bias, precision, and accuracy when compared with (bc-)Chao1 and ACE estimators. Results from empirical data show that the variance generated from TES estimates is comparable with that for (bc-)Chao1 and ACE. Our study demonstrates that rarefaction theory in combination with parametric approximation models provides a valuable new approach to estimate the species richness of incompletely sampled communities. Robust estimates are likely to be obtained where the observed number of species is greater than half of the TES estimation. When the ratio of TESa to the observed richness is ≫2, we suggest the use of TESb or TESab. Although more comprehensive comparisons with other estimators are suggested, we encourage researchers to consider the TES approach in their biodiversity studies as a complement to current existing estimators.},

	abstract = {Measuring ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) could be a valuable method for assessing whether nature-based solutions, such as introducing non-native species to benefit ecosystem functioning, yield net positive outcomes. While EMF metrics may provide a coarse overview of the functioning of a system, such metrics can obscure the interactions among multiple simultaneously occurring ecosystem functions. This could limit the predictive value and overall efficacy of EMF metrics for the management of environmental change impacts on ecosystem functioning. We carried out a mesocosm experiment with dung beetle temporal species richness (diversity) treatments in a pasture ecosystem in Aotearoa New Zealand and quantified cascading biotic and abiotic effects of introduced dung beetles (Onthophagus binodis and Onitis alexis) on multiple ecosystem functions. We measured nine individual ecosystem functions affected by dung beetles, including dung removal, total soil carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, soil microbial respiration, nitrate N, ammonium N, anaerobically mineralisable N and pasture biomass production. We first tested the effects of temporal dung beetle diversity on the nine individual ecosystem functions. We then tested how introduced dung beetle temporal diversity affects ecosystem multifunctionality by calculating EMF metrics using the averaging, threshold and the Hill numbers approaches. Finally, to investigate the underlying interactions among individual functions, we tested the direct and indirect effects of introduced dung beetles on the nine ecosystem functions using structural equation modelling (SEM). Only one out of the nine individual ecosystem functions was significantly affected by dung beetle introductions, whereas five of the six calculated EMF metrics increased significantly with temporal diversity of introduced dung beetles. However, when modelled within an SEM framework, dung beetle temporal diversity was found to directly affect dung removal, but with cascading effects on total N and anaerobically mineralisable N. Our results suggest that introducing and increasing dung beetle temporal diversity enhances the provisioning of multiple ecosystem functions, but that our ability to detect and explain changes in ecosystem multifunctionality is critically dependent on how EMF is quantified.

	abstract = {Ecological communities of tropical regions respond to habitat configuration, being negatively affected by anthropogenic habitats. In the tropics, mountainous highland landscapes sustain ecological communities with contrasting responses to habitat transformation. This study assessed the effect of different habitats under different disturbance regimes on the dung beetle assemblage that inhabits a mountainous Andean landscape in Colombia. The habitat types surveyed were oak forest cores (low intervention), forest edges (medium intervention), and pastures (high intervention). A total of 3,810 dung beetles from ten species were collected. Dung beetle diversity was affected by habitat type, and forest cores and forest edges had higher diversity than pastures. Besides, each habitat type was characterized by a distinct dung beetle assemblage, with pastures showing the highest heterogeneity in the dung beetle assemblage. In conclusion, our study suggests that the dung beetles of a portion of Colombian Andean landscapes are sensitive to shifts of habitat quality. The higher dung beetle diversity in forested habitats indicates that pastures comprise limiting environments for their assemblages at this Andean region.},

Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, Sørensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita–Horn index as special cases.},

It is also impossible to use when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. Many biological and ecological data sets have many variables, are highly skewed, and are zero-inflated. The traditional test and even some more robust alternatives are also unreasonable in many contexts where measures of dispersion based on a non-Euclidean dissimilarity would be more appropriate. Distance-based tests of homogeneity of multivariate dispersions, which can be based on any dissimilarity measure of choice, are proposed here. They rely on the rotational invariance of either the multivariate centroid or the spatial median to obtain measures of spread using principal coordinate axes. The tests are straightforward multivariate extensions of Levene's test, with P-values obtained either using the traditional F-distribution or using permutation of either least-squares or LAD residuals. Examples illustrate the utility of the approach, including the analysis of stabilizing selection in sparrows, biodiversity of New Zealand fish assemblages, and the response of Indonesian reef corals to an El Niño. Monte Carlo simulations from the real data sets show that the distance-based tests are robust and powerful for relevant alternative hypotheses of real differences in spread.},

The sample-size- and coverage-based integrations of rarefaction (interpolation) and extrapolation (prediction) of Hill numbers represent a unified standardization method for quantifying and comparing species diversity across multiple assemblages. We briefly review the conceptual background of Hill numbers along with two approaches to standardization. We present an R package iNEXT (iNterpolation/EXTrapolation) which provides simple functions to compute and plot the seamless rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves for the three most widely used members of the Hill number family (species richness, Shannon diversity and Simpson diversity). Two types of biodiversity data are allowed: individual-based abundance data and sampling-unit-based incidence data. Several applications of the iNEXT packages are reviewed: (i) Non-asymptotic analysis: comparison of diversity estimates for equally large or equally complete samples. (ii) Asymptotic analysis: comparison of estimated asymptotic or true diversities. (iii) Assessment of sample completeness (sample coverage) across multiple samples. (iv) Comparison of estimated point diversities for a specified sample size or a specified level of sample coverage. Two examples are demonstrated, using the data (one for abundance data and the other for incidence data) included in the package, to illustrate all R functions and graphical displays.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss and land-use change in tropical forests have modified the composition and configuration of natural landscapes, driving biodiversity loss. Through studies covering different approaches to diversity and functional traits, a more holistic comprehension may be drawn regarding the effects of habitat transformation. In this study, we evaluated how the forest cover and landscape heterogeneity shape the taxonomic and functional diversity and biomass of dung beetles. Dung beetles were sampled in 16 landscape units of the “Los Tuxtlas” Biosphere Reserve (Mexico). We collected a total of 2396 individuals of 25 species in 14 genera. Taxonomic and functional diversity and biomass of dung beetles were positively related to the amount of primary forest and negatively related to increased landscape heterogeneity. These results indicate that tropical rainforests are highly sensitive to landscape transformation, which jeopardizes the different aspects of biodiversity. By showing the importance of evaluating different facets of biodiversity we conclude that implementing different landscape descriptors and different diversity components is a complementary and efficient approach to assessing the effects of landscape composition on dung beetles’ assemblages in tropical rainforests.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of environmental (associated with the expansion of cattle ranching) and biogeographical factors on the diversity of dung beetle (Scarabaeinae) assemblages along three altitudinal gradients in the Neotropical region. One gradient is located in the Mexican Transition Zone, on the Cofre de Perote mountain, the other two are in the northern Andes (the Chiles Volcano and the Río Cusiana Basin). For the three gradients, the number of species and of individuals was similar in both forest and pasture, while species composition was different between habitats. On this mountain, species turnover in pastures was characterized by the addition of new species as altitude increased. In the northern Andes, species diversity was always greater in the forest than in the pasture, and species turnover between habitats was notably influenced by species loss with increasing altitude. As such the pasture fauna of the northern Andes was an impoverished derivative of the fauna present in the forests at the same altitude characterized by species of Neotropical affinity with a limited capacity for colonizing open, sunnier habitats. The opposite occurs in the areas used by cattle on the Cofre de Perote. This habitat has its own fauna, which is mainly comprised of Holarctic and Afrotropical species adapted to the prevailing environmental conditions of areas lacking arboreal vegetation. These results suggest that the impact on beetle communities caused by human activities can differ depending on the geographic position of each mountain and, particularly, the biogeographical history of the species assemblage that lives there.},

We compared the response of native forest dung beetle communities to cattle grazing under regional contexts differing on precipitation patterns (Atlantic forest and humid and dry Chaco). Through multivariate and GLMM analyses we contrasted richness and composition across regions and land uses and explored the role of local and regional variables accounting for those changes. We captured a total of 44101 individuals of 109 species. The interaction between local and regional variables influenced the response to livestock management. In the two wet regions (humid Chaco and Atlantic forest) diversity was similar in the native forest regardless of cattle presence but differs strongly in open pastures. In contrast, in the dry Chaco, differences between native forest and land use were not evident. Vegetation structure was a major determinant of species richness, whereas regional climate determined differences in species composition. We concluded that the response of dung beetles to livestock management cannot be generalized for all biomes. In dry ecosystems, dung beetles are probably pre-adapted to environmental conditions imposed by cattle ranching whereas in wet ecosystems the impact of cattle ranching is more significant.},

This study explored physiological parameters of dung beetles in two contrasting ecoregions of Argentina: Paranaense Forest and Dry Chaco. We capture dung beetles from both regions and habitats with different degrees of disturbance within each region, and performed lab experiments on metabolic rate and thermal tolerance. This study revealed that dung beetles inhabiting regions or habitats with higher temperatures (Dry Chaco and open pastures) showed greater temperature tolerance compared to those inhabiting regions or habitats with lower temperatures (Paranaense Forest and habitats preserving tree canopy). Furthermore, in the Dry Chaco, more species exploit open disturbed habitats, indicating less physiological sensitivity to temperature changes than dung beetles in the Paranaense Forest. This study is the first to compare dung beetle assemblages at both regional and local scales. The findings highlight the importance of preserving tree canopy in land use planning to mitigate microclimatic changes, especially in humid forests, to support dung beetle populations and their crucial ecosystem roles in the face of climate change.},

Dung beetles are one of the most diverse and functionally important taxa; through organic matter burial, dung beetles improve soil quality. We collected dung beetles in native forests and cattle ranching areas in subtropical forests with contrasting climatic conditions: the Atlantic Forest, the Humid Chaco, and the Dry Chaco. We measured 11 traits related to the ecology and the physiology of species. Irrespectively of the region, functional richness was higher in forests (native and with cattle) when compared to open pastures. Humid forests (Atlantic Forest and Humid Chaco) showed higher functional richness than Dry Chaco. Functional dispersion in humid forests was similar between native forest and livestock systems, however, functional dispersion in the Dry Chaco was higher in open pastures compared to native forest. According to our results, native forests and forests with cattle maintain functional diversity in all regions. However, in the case of open pastures, the response depends on the regional context; the replacement of native forest by open pastures strongly affected functional diversity in humid forests and showed less impact on dry forest.},

	abstract = {A number of metrics for quantifying the amount of functional redundancy in a community have been proposed over the years. Two of the most popular metrics are based on comparing a taxonomic diversity measure with a generalized form of the same measure that accounts for functional dissimilarities between taxa. These two metrics express redundancy as either an absolute or relative difference between the taxonomic diversity measure and its generalized form. Because they express the amount of redundancy in a community in terms of raw diversity values, both redundancy metrics are susceptible to the same issues that complicate the interpretation of most commonly used diversity indices. It is possible to overcome these issues by restating these two indices using a Hill numbers framework. As a growing number of authors have noted, these modified metrics provide a more intuitive quantitative definition of functional redundancy when used to rank communities. Beyond this intuitive definition, measuring redundancy in terms of Hill numbers allows researchers to control the influence of rare taxa on the output value, enabling ecologists to better predict how a community is expected to respond when exposed to an external perturbation that selectively eliminates rare or common taxa. Here I show that, of the two possible Hill number-based redundancy metrics, the form based on a popular absolute redundancy metric is extremely sensitive to differences in taxonomic diversity and can provide a misleading picture of how much redundancy is present in a community. For this reason, I argue that Hill number-based functional redundancy should be quantified using a relative metric that explicitly accounts for differences in effective taxonomic diversity. The proposed Hill number-based relative redundancy measure is shown to provide a much more complete picture of the distribution of redundant taxa within a community, highlighting subtle patterns that are completely missed by the Hill number-based absolute redundancy metric. I include open-source R code for calculating the indices discussed here. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.},

	abstract = {Based on the framework of attribute diversity (a generalization of Hill numbers of order q), we develop a class of functional diversity measures sensitive not only to species abundances but also to trait-based species-pairwise functional distances. The new method refines and improves on the conventional species-equivalent approach in three areas: (1) the conventional method often gives similar values (close to unity) to assemblages with contrasting levels of functional diversity; (2) when a distance metric is unbounded, the conventional functional diversity depends on the presence/absence of other assemblages in the study; (3) in partitioning functional gamma diversity into alpha and beta components, the conventional gamma is sometimes less than alpha. To resolve these issues, we add to the attribute-diversity framework a novel concept: τ, the threshold of functional distinctiveness between any two species; here, τ can be chosen to be any positive value. Any two species with functional distance ≥ τ are treated as functionally equally distinct. Our functional diversity quantifies the effective number of functionally equally distinct species (or “virtual functional groups”) with all pairwise distances at least τ for different species pairs. We advocate the use of two complementary diversity profiles (τ profile and q profile), which depict functional diversity with varying levels of τ and q, respectively. Both the conventional species-equivalent method (i.e., τ is the maximum of species-pairwise distances) and classic taxonomic diversity (i.e., τ is the minimum of non-zero species-pairwise distances) are incorporated into our proposed τ profile for an assemblage. For any type of species-pairwise distance matrices, our attribute-diversity approach allows proper diversity partitioning, with the desired property gamma ≥ alpha and thus avoids all the restrictions that apply to the conventional diversity decomposition. Our functional alpha and gamma are interpreted as the effective numbers of functionally equally distinct species, respectively, in an assemblage and in the pooled assemblage, while beta is the effective number of equally large assemblages with no shared species and all species in the assemblages being equally distinct. The resulting beta diversity can be transformed to obtain abundance-sensitive Sørensen- and Jaccard-type functional (dis)similarity profiles. Hypothetical and real examples are used to illustrate the framework. Online software and R codes are available to facilitate computations.},

	abstract = {Based on sampling data, we propose a rigorous standardization method to measure and compare beta diversity across datasets. Here beta diversity, which quantifies the extent of among-assemblage differentiation, relies on Whittaker's original multiplicative decomposition scheme, but we use Hill numbers for any diversity order q ≥ 0. Richness-based beta diversity (q = 0) quantifies the extent of species identity shift, whereas abundance-based (q {\textgreater} 0) beta diversity also quantifies the extent of difference among assemblages in species abundance. We adopt and define the assumptions of a statistical sampling model as the foundation for our approach, treating sampling data as a representative sample taken from an assemblage. The approach makes a clear distinction between the theoretical assemblage level (unknown properties/parameters of the assemblage) and the sampling data level (empirical/observed statistics computed from data). At the assemblage level, beta diversity for N assemblages reflects the interacting effect of the species abundance distribution and spatial/temporal aggregation of individuals in the assemblage. Under independent sampling, observed beta (= gamma/alpha) diversity depends not only on among-assemblage differentiation but also on sampling effort/completeness, which in turn induces dependence of beta on alpha and gamma diversity. How to remove the dependence of richness-based beta diversity on its gamma component (species pool) has been intensely debated. Our approach is to standardize gamma and alpha based on sample coverage (an objective measure of sample completeness). For a single assemblage, the iNEXT method was developed, through interpolation (rarefaction) and extrapolation with Hill numbers, to standardize samples by sampling effort/completeness. Here we adapt the iNEXT standardization to alpha and gamma diversity, that is, alpha and gamma diversity are both assessed at the same level of sample coverage, to formulate standardized, coverage-based beta diversity. This extension of iNEXT to beta diversity required the development of novel concepts and theories, including a formal proof and simulation-based demonstration that the resulting standardized beta diversity removes the dependence of beta diversity on both gamma and alpha values, and thus reflects the pure among-assemblage differentiation. The proposed standardization is illustrated with spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal datasets, while the freeware iNEXT.beta3D facilitates all computations and graphics.},

	abstract = {While small-scale studies show that more diverse native communities are less invasible by exotics, studies at large spatial scales often find positive correlations between native and exotic diversity. This large-scale pattern is thought to arise because landscapes with favorable conditions for native species also have favorable conditions for exotic species. From theory, we proposed an alternative hypothesis: the positive relationship at large scales is driven by spatial heterogeneity in species composition, which is driven by spatial heterogeneity in the environment. Landscapes with more spatial heterogeneity in the environment can sustain more native and more exotic species, leading to a positive correlation of native and exotic diversity at large scales. In a nested data set for grassland plants, we detected negative relationships between native and exotic diversity at small spatial scales and positive relationships at large spatial scales. Supporting our hypothesis, the positive relationships, between native and exotic diversity at large scales were driven by positive relationships between native and exotic beta diversity. Further, both native and exotic diversity were positively correlated with spatial heterogeneity in abiotic conditions (variance of soil depth, soil nitrogen, and aspect) but were uncorrelated with average abiotic conditions, supporting the spatial-heterogeneity hypothesis but not the favorable-conditions hypothesis.},

The events occurred on normal (mostly clear, calm) autumn 2005 and spring 2006 late afternoons near Flagstaff, Arizona. Flight days were either near the full moon or in advanced waning lunar periods. At least 18 species were involved in the flights, with as many as 16 species (7 species of Heteroptera in 3 families, 9 species of Coleoptera in 2 families) in a single flight. Heteroptera (especially from the family Corixidae) were 2-4 orders of magnitude more numerous than Coleoptera. The diasporas plummeted, with much direct mortality, onto green metal roofs, and the largest event lasted more than 2 hours. Even after 2 days, uninjured individuals failed to resume their flights. The literature suggests that such flights occur for autumn movement to winter habitats or for location of springtime habitats for reproduction. The relative proportions of species in flocks were similar neither to the relative proportions in the region not, to those in nearby livestock watering tanks, indicating that the flights consisted of nonrandom assemblages of species. These events are rare or unique observations of coordinated movement of mixed predatory and scavenging invertebrate species.},

	title = {New fungus-insect symbiosis: {Culturing}, molecular, and histological methods determine saprophytic polyporales mutualists of ambrosiodmus ambrosia beetles},
	volume = {10},
	abstract = {Ambrosia symbiosis is an obligate, farming-like mutualism between wood-boring beetles and fungi. It evolved at least 11 times and includes many notorious invasive pests. All ambrosia beetles studied to date cultivate ascomycotan fungi: early colonizers of recently killed trees with poor wood digestion. Beetles in the widespread genus Ambrosiodmus, however, colonize decayed wood. We characterized the mycosymbionts of three Ambrosiodmus species using quantitative culturing, high-throughput metabarcoding, and histology. We determined the fungi to be within the Polyporales, closely related to Flavodon flavus. Culture-independent sequencing of Ambrosiodmus minor mycangia revealed a single operational taxonomic unit identical to the sequences from the cultured Flavodon. Histological sectioning confirmed that Ambrosiodmus possessed preoral mycangia containing dimitic hyphae similar to cultured F. cf. flavus. The Ambrosiodmus-Flavodon symbiosis is unique in several aspects: it is the first reported association between an ambrosia beetle and a basidiomycotan fungus; the mycosymbiont grows as hyphae in the mycangia, not as budding pseudo-mycelium; and the mycosymbiont is a white-rot saprophyte rather than an early colonizer: a previously undocumented wood borer niche. Few fungi are capable of turning rotten wood into complete animal nutrition. Several thousand beetle-fungus symbioses remain unstudied and promise unknown and unexpected mycological diversity and enzymatic innovations.},

	volume = {108},
	abstract = {Bark and ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae \& Platypodinae) are among the most damaging forest pests worldwide, and monitoring is essential to damage prevention. Unfortunately, traps and attractants that are currently used are costly, and agencies rely on limited field personnel for deployment. The situation can be greatly aided by 1) the development of cost-effective trapping techniques, and 2) distribution of the effort through the Citizen Science approach. The goal of this study was to test a simple, effective trap that can be made and deployed by anyone interested in collecting bark and ambrosia beetles. Three trap types made from 2-liter soda bottles and, separately, four attractants were compared. Simple, one-window traps performed comparably at capturing species in traps painted or with multiple windows. A comparison of attractants in two-window traps found that 95\% ethanol attracted the highest number of species but that Purell hand sanitizer (70\% ethanol) and then Germ-X hand sanitizer (63\% ethanol) were also effective. A perforated zip-top plastic bag containing Purell hanging over a trap filled with automobile antifreeze attracted the fewest species and individual specimens. Overall, ¿ 4,500 bark and ambrosia beetles, including 30 species were captured, representing a third of the regional species diversity. More than three quarters of the specimens were nonnative, representing nearly half of the known regional exotic species. These results suggest that simple one-window soda bottle traps baited with ethanol-based hand sanitizer will be effective and inexpensive tools for large-scale monitoring of bark and ambrosia beetles.},

	volume = {106},
	abstract = {Significant mortality of redbay trees (Persea borbonia (L.) Spreng.) in the southeastern United States has been caused by Raffaelea lauricola, T. C. Harr., Fraedrich, \& Aghayeva (Harrington et al. 2008), a fungal symbiont of the exotic redbay ambrosia beetle, Xyleborus glabratus, Eichhoff (Fraedrich et al. 2008). This pathogen causes laurel wilt, which is an irreversible disease that can kill mature trees within a few weeks in summer. R. lauricola has been shown to be lethal to most native species of Lauraceae and cultivated avocado (Persea americana Mill.) in the southeastern United States. In this study, we examined the survival of X. glabratus and R. lauricola in wood chips made from infested trees by using a standard tree chipper over a 10-wk period. After 2 wk, 14 X. glabratus were recovered from wood chips, whereas 339 X. glabratus emerged from nonchipped bolts. R. lauricola was not found 2 d postchipping from wood chips, indicating that the pathogen is not likely to survive for long inside wood chips. In contrast, R. lauricola persisted in dead, standing redbay trees for 14 mo. With large volumes of wood, the potential for infested logs to be moved between states or across U. S. borders is significant. Results demonstrated that chipping wood from laurel wilt-killed trees can significantly reduce the number of X. glabratus and limit the persistence of R. lauricola, which is important for sanitation strategies aimed at limiting the spread of this disease.},

	title = {Discordant phylogenies suggest repeated host shifts in the {Fusarium}-{Euwallacea} ambrosia beetle mutualism},
	volume = {82},
	abstract = {The mutualism between xyleborine beetles in the genus Euwallacea (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) and members of the Ambrosia Fusarium Clade (AFC) represents one of 11 known evolutionary origins of fungiculture by ambrosia beetles. Female Euwallacea beetles transport fusarial symbionts in paired mandibular mycangia from their natal gallery to woody hosts where they are cultivated in galleries as a source of food. Native to Asia, several exotic Euwallacea species were introduced into the United States and Israel within the past two decades and they now threaten urban landscapes, forests and avocado production. To assess species limits and to date the evolutionary diversification of the mutualists, we reconstructed the evolutionary histories of key representatives of the Fusarium and Euwallacea clades using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. Twelve species-level lineages, termed AF 112, were identified within the monophyletic AFC and seven among the Fusarium-farming Euwallacea. Bayesian diversification-time estimates placed the origin of the Euwallacea-Fusarium mutualism near the Oligocene-Miocene boundary similar to 19-24 Mya. Most Euwallacea spp. appear to be associated with one species of Fusarium, but two species farmed two closely related fusaria. Euwallacea sp. \#2 in Miami-Dade County, Florida cultivated Fusarium spp. AF-6 and AF-8 on avocado, and Euwallacea sp. \#4 farmed Fusarium ambrosium AF-1 and Fusarium sp. AF-11 on Chinese tea in Sri Lanka. Cophylogenetic analyses indicated that the Euwallacea and Fusarium phylogenies were largely incongruent, apparently due to the beetles switching fusarial symbionts (i.e., host shifts) at least five times during the evolution of this mutualism. Three cospeciation events between Euwallacea and their AFC symbionts were detected, but randomization tests failed to reject the null hypothesis that the putative parallel cladogenesis is a stochastic pattern. Lastly, two collections of Euwallacea sp. \#2 from Miami-Dade County, Florida shared an identical cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) allele with Euwallacea validus, suggesting introgressive hybridization between these species and/or pseudogenous nature of this marker. Results of the present study highlight the importance of understanding the potential for and frequency of host-switching between Euwallacea and members of the AFC, and that these shifts may bring together more aggressive and virulent combinations of these invasive mutualists.

              1. Studies of north temperate dung beetle communities frequently invoke competition as an influential ecological process. In this review, the evidence for competition in north temperate dung beetle communities is evaluated and the role of competition as a factor affecting community structure is assessed.
            
            2. Resource limitation and the evidence for interspecific competition are assessed by collating the available experimental and observational evidence for both the adult and larval stages of the dung beetle life cycle. The role of competition as a structuring force in dung beetle communities is discussed under the following headings: niche dynamics, migration to and from individual pats, the aggregation model of co‐existence, and metapopulations.
            3. Some of the main conclusions are that competition for space is much more likely to occur than competition for food; the effects of competition on community structure are poorly understood; several of the influential studies of competition in north temperate dung beetle communities need to be evaluated carefully. The differences in ecology between tropical and temperate dung beetle communities are clarified.
            4. As priorities for future research, resource utilisation and competition should be researched experimentally: density‐dependent relationships should be investigated, particularly for the larval stages, as should competitive interactions with other dung fauna. If such experimental approaches establish convincingly the occurrence of competition, then the extent of competition in the field and under real world conditions needs to be established. A functional group classification of dung beetles and other dung fauna is described, which may improve the generality of interpretation from individual, site‐specific results.},

Among susceptible Lauraceae hosts are redbay Persea borbonia and avocado Persea americana. There is a crucial need for detection of this pest as it moves into new areas. Consequently, our goal was to create a better lure for the monitoring and control of redbay ambrosia beetle. We analyzed volatile emissions of R. lauricola, created a synthetic odour blend based on this analysis and tested this odour blend as a potential attractant in a redbay forest infested with X. glabratus. The synthetic Raffaelea odour blend was not attractive to the beetles by itself. However, it synergistically increased attraction to host-mimic volatiles. We tested four commercial release devices for dispensing Raffaelea odour at various release rates. Two prototypes with the highest release rate, when paired with commercial manuka oil lures, captured more beetles than manuka oil lures alone. These results indicate that a synthetic blend of volatiles based on the odour of the symbiotic fungus of X. glabratus may be useful for the development of more sensitive monitoring lures for this invasive pathogen vector.},

By examining odors of redbay wood, we developed an artificial lure that captured X. glabratus in redbay forests. Eucalyptol was a critical component of the blend for beetle attraction, and eucalyptol alone in large quantities attracted X. glabratus. Furthermore, eucalyptol stimulated boring by X. glabratus into paper arenas.

	volume = {9},
	abstract = {Symbioses are increasingly seen as dynamic ecosystems with multiple associates and varying fidelity. Symbiont specificity remains elusive in one of the most ecologically successful and economically damaging eukaryotic symbioses: the ambrosia symbiosis of wood-boring beetles and fungi. We used multiplexed pyrosequencing of amplified internal transcribed spacer II (ITS2) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) libraries to document the communities of fungal associates and symbionts inside the mycangia (fungus transfer organ) of three ambrosia beetle species, Xyleborus affinis, Xyleborus ferrugineus and Xylosandrus crassiusculus. We processed 93 beetle samples from 5 locations across Florida, including reference communities. Fungal communities within mycangia included 14-20 fungus species, many more than reported by culture-based studies. We recovered previously known nutritional symbionts as members of the core community. We also detected several other fungal taxa that are equally frequent but whose function is unknown and many other transient species. The composition of fungal assemblages was significantly correlated with beetle species but not with locality. The type of mycangium appears to determine specificity: two Xyleborus with mandibular mycangia had multiple dominant associates with even abundances; Xylosandrus crassiusculus (mesonotal mycangium) communities were dominated by a single symbiont, Ambrosiella sp. Beetle mycangia also carried many fungi from the environment, including plant pathogens and endophytes. The ITS2 marker proved useful for ecological analyses, but the taxonomic resolution was limited to fungal genus or family, particularly in Ophiostomatales, which are under-represented in our amplicons as well as in public databases. This initial analysis of three beetle species suggests that each clade of ambrosia beetles and each mycangium type may support a functionally and taxonomically distinct symbiosis.},

	volume = {56},
	abstract = {Ambrosia beetle fungiculture represents one of the most ecologically and evolutionarily successful symbioses, as evidenced by the 11 independent origins and 3500 species of ambrosia beetles. Here we document the evolution of a clade within Fusarium associated with ambrosia beetles in the genus Euwallacea (Coleoptera: Scolytinae). Ambrosia Fusarium Clade (AFC) symbionts are unusual in that some are plant pathogens that cause significant damage in naive natural and cultivated ecosystems, and currently threaten avocado production in the United States, Israel and Australia. Most AFC fusaria produce unusual clavate macroconidia that serve as a putative food source for their insect mutualists. AFC symbionts were abundant in the heads of four Euwallacea spp., which suggests that they are transported within and from the natal gallery in mandibular mycangia. In a four-locus phylogenetic analysis, the AFC was resolved in a strongly supported monophyletic group within the previously described Cade 3 of the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC). Divergence-time estimates place the origin of the AFC in the early Miocene similar to 21.2 Mya, which coincides with the hypothesized adaptive radiation of the Xyleborini. Two strongly supported clades within the AFC (Clades A and B) were identified that include nine species lineages associated with ambrosia beetles, eight with Euwallacea spp. and one reportedly with Xyleborus ferrugineus, and two lineages with no known beetle association. More derived lineages within the AFC showed fixation of the clavate (club-shaped) macroconidial trait, while basal lineages showed a mix of clavate and more typical fusiform macroconidia. AFC lineages consisted mostly of genetically identical individuals associated with specific insect hosts in defined geographic locations, with at least three interspecific hybridization events inferred based on discordant placement in individual gene genealogies and detection of recombinant loci. Overall, these data are consistent with a strong evolutionary trend toward obligate symbiosis coupled with secondary contact and interspecific hybridization. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The research field of animal and plant symbioses is advancing from studying interactions between two species to whole communities of associates. High-throughput sequencing of microbial communities supports multiplexed sampling for statistically robust tests of hypotheses about symbiotic associations. We focus on ambrosia beetles, the increasingly damaging insects primarily associated with fungal symbionts, which have also been reported to support bacteria. To analyze the diversity, composition, and specificity of the beetles' prokaryotic associates, we combine global sampling, insect anatomy, 454 sequencing of bacterial rDNA, and multivariate statistics to analyze prokaryotic communities in ambrosia beetle mycangia, organs mostly known for transporting symbiotic fungi. We analyze six beetle species that represent three types of mycangia and include several globally distributed species, some with major economic importance (Dendroctonus frontalis, Xyleborus affinis, Xyleborus bispinatus-ferrugineus, Xyleborus glabratus, Xylosandrus crassiusculus, and Xylosandrus germanus). Ninety-six beetle mycangia yielded 1,546 bacterial phylotypes. Several phylotypes appear to form the core microbiome of the mycangium. Three Mycoplasma (originally thought restricted to vertebrates), two Burkholderiales, and two Pseudomonadales are repeatedly present worldwide in multiple beetle species. However, no bacterial phylotypes were universally present, suggesting that ambrosia beetles are not obligately dependent on bacterial symbionts. The composition of bacterial communities is structured by the host beetle species more than by the locality of origin, which suggests that more bacteria are vertically transmitted than acquired from the environment. The invasive X. glabratus and the globally distributed X. crassiusculus have unique sets of bacteria, different from species native to North America. We conclude that the mycangium hosts in multiple vertically transmitted bacteria such as Mycoplasma, most of which are likely facultative commensals or parasites.},

However, this guild was poor in species (12 species) and restricted to only three plant families (Moraceae, Myristicaceae, Sapindaceae). 6.

We sampled ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera, Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Platypodinae) from four tree species: Artocarpus altilis, Ficus nodosa, Leea indica and Nauclea orientalis, at three sites forming a 1000 km transect in lowland rainforests of northern Papua New Guinea. A standardized volume of wood from trunk, branches and twigs was sampled for ambrosia beetles from three individuals of the four tree species at each site. Each tree was killed standing and left exposed to beetle colonization for 20 days prior to sampling. We obtained 12 751 individuals from 84 morphospecies of ambrosia beetles. We surveyed most of the local species richness at each site, predicted by Chao 2 species richness estimates. The similarity of ambrosia beetle communities, estimated by Chao-Sorensen index, was not correlated with their geographical distance. Likelihood analysis and Q-mode analysis using Monte Carlo-generated null distribution of beetles among sites supported the hypothesis that the assemblages of ambrosia beetles at different sites are drawn from the same species pool, regardless of their geographical distance. Tree part (trunk, branch, or twig) was more important predictor of the composition of ambrosia beetle communities than was the host species or geographical location. All three variables, however, explained only a small portion of variability in ambrosia assemblages. The distribution of ambrosia beetles among tree parts, tree species and study sites was mostly random, suggesting limited importance of host specificity or dispersal limitation.},

	abstract = {Ambrosia beetles, dominant wood degraders in the tropics, create tunnels in dead trees and employ gardens of symbiotic fungi to extract nutrients from wood. Specificity of the beetle-fungus relationship has rarely been examined, and simple vertical transmission of a specific fungal cultivar by each beetle species is often assumed in literature. We report repeated evolution of fungal crop stealing, termed mycocleptism, among ambrosia beetles. The mycocleptic species seek brood galleries of other species, and exploit their established fungal gardens by tunneling through the ambient mycelium-laden wood. Instead of carrying their own fungal sybmbionts, mycocleptae depend on adopting the fungal assemblages of their host species, as shown by an analysis of fungal DNA from beetle galleries. The evidence for widespread horizontal exchange of fungi between beetles challenges the traditional concept of ambrosia fungi as species-specific symbionts. Fungus stealing appears to be an evolutionarily successful strategy. It evolved independently in several beetle clades, two of which have radiated, and at least one case was accompanied by a loss of the beetles' fungus-transporting organs. We demonstrate this using the first robust phylogeny of one of the world's largest group of ambrosia beetles, Xyleborini.},

	abstract = {Many ecological studies of tropical insects are based on small sample sizes or lack sampling scheme rigor, which prevents testing ecological hypotheses and comparing samples from different sites and times. Here we present the results of quantitative trapping of bark and ambrosia beetles over 2 yr at two localities in northern Thailand separated by 5 km, 1,100 m in altitude, and in different forest types. Beetles were collected using a spatially and temporally standardized sampling scheme, followed by a quantitative analysis of community composition and its responses to environmental variables and trapping techniques. In total, 118 species were collected, but the species accumulation curves show little sign of leveling off. Based on slightly different species accumulation rates, the more humid site has a little higher species richness. Species composition was significantly different between the sites, which was not a result of undersampling of rare species. a diversity at each site contributes to the regional diversity more than the turnover of species between the sites ((3 diversity). Mean annual temperature and humidity have larger effects on the community species composition than seasonal fluctuations of temperature and humidity at each site-beetles do choose their environment but are aseasonal. The site with greater humidity supported significantly more species living in a symbiosis with fungi (ambrosia beetles), whereas the drier and more disturbed site hosted a greater number of circumtropical colonizer species. Each of the different types of trap had a bias for certain taxonomic groups. The results show that even modest samples, if properly structured and analyzed, can answer many ecological questions and can serve in biodiversity comparisons on broad scales.},

We tested effects of revegetation of grazing land formerly vegetated by eucalyptus woodland on trophic groups of epigaeic beetles, considering a restoration chronosequence (space-for-time substitution). We used paddocks (i.e. grazed pastures) as the start point, sites in two age classes (5-8 and 12-17 since years since replanting) and fenced woodland remnants to represent the desired end point. Phytophages were most common in young revegetated sites, which had reduced grazing pressure and low canopy cover. Assemblage composition of both saprophages and predators converged on those of remnants over "time". Paddock sites had the lowest species evenness of saprophages, with two species being particularly common. Saprophage assemblages in paddocks were also more homogeneous than those in other site types i.e. between site variation in assemblage composition was low. Predators were smaller but more species-rich in sites with less coarse woody debris, canopy cover and litter, possibly responding to higher abundances of small prey. Beetle biomass did not differ across habitats. For saprophages, a greater abundance in paddocks was counterbalanced by reduced body size. Remnants did not support a significantly greater proportion of habitat-specific species. However, more species than expected were specific to treed sites. Our study supports previous findings that habitat structure is a key driver of beetle community restoration. It also suggests that epigaeic assemblages respond relatively rapidly to revegetation, probably because they do not require resources that develop over long periods of time. The similarities in biomass for all trophic groups across sites suggest that beetle-performed functions may operate similarly in different stages, reflecting high functional resilience of epigaeic beetle assemblages in this landscape.

In this study, we include 155 xyleborine species representing 23 genera in parsimony and Bayesian analyses using 3925 nucleotides from mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear genomes (28S, ArgK, CAD, EF-1 alpha) and 39 morphological characters. The phylogenies resulting from the parsimony analyses, which treated gap positions either as missing or fifth character states, and the Bayesian analysis were generally similar. Clades with high support or posterior probabilities were found in all trees, while those with low support were not recovered by all analyses. Fourteen of the 23 genera were monophyletic although not all relationships among the genera were resolved. We show monophyly of several species groups associated with particular morphological and biological characters and suggest recognition of these groups as genera. Most interesting was the monophyly of South and Central American species representing several genera. This finding suggests recent and fast radiation of xyleborines in the New World accompanied by morphological and biological diversification.},

	abstract = {An ecological network refers to the ecological interactions among sets of species. Quantification of ecological network diversity and related sampling/estimation challenges have explicit analogues in species diversity research. A unified framework based on Hill numbers and their generalizations was developed to quantify taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity. Drawing on this unified framework, we propose three dimensions of network diversity that incorporate the frequency (or strength) of interactions, species phylogenies and traits. As with surveys in species inventories, nearly all network studies are based on sampling data and thus also suffer from under-sampling effects. Adapting the sampling/estimation theory and the iNEXT (interpolation/extrapolation) standardization developed for species diversity research, we propose the iNEXT.link method to analyse network sampling data. The proposed method integrates the following four inference procedures: (i) assessment of sample completeness of networks; (ii) asymptotic analysis via estimating the true network diversity; (iii) non-asymptotic analysis based on standardizing sample completeness via rarefaction and extrapolation with network diversity; and (iv) estimation of the degree of unevenness or specialization in networks based on standardized diversity. Interaction data between European trees and saproxylic beetles are used to illustrate the proposed procedures. The software iNEXT.link has been developed to facilitate all computations and graphics.

	abstract = {In nearly every forest habitat, ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae, Platypodinae) plant and maintain symbiotic fungus gardens inside dead or dying trees. Some non-native ambrosia beetles aggressively attack live trees and damage tree crops, lumber, and native woody plant taxa by introducing ambrosia fungi, some of which are plant pathogens. Most established exotic species, however, do not cause any economic damage, and consequently are little studied. To determine the specificity and diversity of ambrosia symbionts in under-studied non-native beetles in Florida, fungi were isolated from three species: Xylosandrus amputatus, Xyleborinus andrewesi, and Dryoxylon onoharaense. Two of the beetles sampled each yielded a fungal species isolated with 100 \% frequency: X. amputatus: Ambrosiella beaveri or A. nakashimae, and X. andrewesi: Raffaelea sp. nov. nr. canadensis. Both of these symbionts have been isolated previously from closely related ambrosia beetles, supporting the hypothesis that some beetles can carry monocultures of fungi, but the fungi may not be specific to single beetle species. No consistent fungi were isolated from Dryoxylon onoharaense, raising questions about whether or not it truly carries its own symbionts. These results are now being used to test hypotheses and models explaining the evolution of pathogenicity within ambrosia fungi and invasion ability within exotic beetle-fungus complexes.},

	abstract = {Background High altitude insects are an ecologically specialized group and possess a suite of adaptions which allow persistence in the inhospitable conditions often associated with mountain tops. Changes in body coloration and reductions or increases in body size are thought to be examples of such adaptions. Melanic individuals, or individuals containing high levels of eumelanin, possess several traits which increase resistance to ultraviolet radiation and desiccation, while aiding thermoregulation. Trait variation is often observed in dung beetles and is associated with dimorphism and sexual selection. In this study, we identified trait changes which occur across an altitudinal gradient by measuring morphological color and body size traits in a montane insect. Methods Using standard digital photography and Image J, we examined individuals of Afromontane dung beetle Onthophagus proteus. Individuals were classified according to sex and color morph to identify intrasexual variance. Nine morphometric traits were measured per beetle to identify patterns of morphology across discrete 500 m altitude segments. Results The results of this study provide one of the first descriptions of trait changes associated with elevation in an African dung beetle. We suggest that color polymorphism in Onthophagus proteus might be at least partly driven by environmental factors as there is significantly increased melanism with increasing elevation and significant differences in color hues between altitude bands. We also suggest changes in horn length are density dependent, as we observed an increase in cephalic horn length at high elevations where O. proteus is the most abundant species.},

	abstract = {Indicator taxa are commonly used to identify priority areas for conservation or to measure biological responses to environmental change. Despite their widespread use, there is no general consensus about the ability of indicator taxa to predict wider trends in biodiversity. Many studies have focused on large-scale patterns of species co-occurrence to identify areas of high biodiversity, threat or endemism, but there is much less information about patterns of species co-occurrence at local scales. In this study, we assess fine-scale co-occurrence patterns of three indicator taxa (epiphytic ferns, leaf litter frogs and dung beetles) across a remotely sensed gradient of human disturbance in the Ecuadorian Amazon. We measure the relative contribution of rare and common species to patterns of total richness in each taxon and determine the ability of common and rare species to act as surrogate measures of human disturbance and each other. We find that the species richness of indicator taxa changed across the human disturbance gradient but that the response differed among taxa, and between rare and common species. Although we find several patterns of co-occurrence, these patterns differed between common and rare species. Despite showing complex patterns of species co-occurrence, our results suggest that species or taxa can act as reliable indicators of each other but that this relationship must be established and not assumed.},

	volume = {25},
	abstract = {Understanding the relative influence of environmental and spatial variables in driving variation in species diversity and composition is an important and growing area of ecological research. We examined how fire, local vegetation structure and landscape configuration interact to influence dung beetle communities in Amazonian savannas, using both hierarchical partitioning and variance partitioning techniques to quantify independent effects. We captured a total of 3,334 dung beetles from 15 species at 22 savanna plots in 2003. The species accumulation curve was close to reaching an asymptote at a regional scale, but curves were variable at the plot level where total abundance ranged from 17 to 410 individuals. Most plots were dominated by just three species that accounted for 87.7\% of all individuals sampled. Hierarchical partitioning revealed the strong independent and positive effect of percentage forest cover in the surrounding landscape on total dung beetle abundance and species richness, and richness of uncommon species and the tunneler guild. Forest cover also had a negative effect on community evenness. None of the variables that related to fire affected community metrics. The minimal direct influence of fire was supported by variance partitioning: partialling out the influence of spatial position and vegetation removed all of the individual explanation attributable to fire, whereas 8\% of the variance was explained by vegetation and 28\% was explained by spatial variables (when partialling out effects of the other two variables). Space-fire and vegetation-fire joint effects explained 14 and 10\% of the dung beetle community variability, respectively. These results suggest that much of the variation in dung beetle assemblages in savannas can be attributed to the spatial location of sites, forest cover (which increased the occurrence of uncommon species), and the indirect effects of fires on vegetation (that was also dependent on spatial location). Our study also highlights the utility of partitioning techniques for examining the importance of environment variables such as fire that can be strongly influenced by spatial location.},

Cattle pastures dominated by introduced grasses are a characteristic component of many tropical landscapes in Brazil, yet little information is available concerning the insect communities that inhabit these novel ecosystems. 2. Dung beetles are a conspicuous element of pasture insect communities, and make a significant contribution to dung decomposition, parasitic fly control, and soil bioturbation. 3. We sampled dung beetle assemblages in twelve introduced pastures near Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We used pitfall traps baited separately with cow and horse dung, and collected a total of 456 dung beetles, comprising 23 species from 13 different genera. We analysed patterns of alpha and beta diversity, community structure, and species composition among pastures and bait types. 4. Cow dung harboured significantly more species, but a similar abundance of dung beetles compared with horse dung. However, both dung types supported species exclusive to that type, and hosted a distinct dung beetle community structure and composition. 5. Although livestock (cattle and horses) was introduced to Brazil less than 500 years ago, our data suggest that novel and well-structured dung beetle communities are actively exploiting these novel food resources in Brazilian pasturelands.},

	abstract = {Different distribution maps can be obtained for the same species if localities where species are present are mapped at different times. We analysed the accumulation of information over time for a group of dung beetle species in the Iberian Peninsula. To do this, we used all available information about the distribution of the group as well as data on selected species to examine if the process of discovery of species distribution has occurred in a climatically or spatially structured fashion. Our results show the existence of a well-defined pattern of temporal growth in distributional information; due to this, the date of capture of each specimen can be explained by the environmental and spatial variables associated to the collection sites. We hypothesize that such temporal biases could be the rule rather than the exception in most distributional data. These biases could affect the weighting of environmental factors that influence species distributions, as well as the accuracy of predictive distribution models. Systematic surveys should be a priority for the description of species geographical ranges in order to make robust predictions about the consequences of habitat and climate change for their persistence and conservation.},

Southern localities are characterized by a larger number of species and a significantly higher number of scarabaeine species than northern localities (only southern communities located inside the Chihuahuan desert do not conform to this pattern). To explain the latitudinal pattern in faunistic composition and number of species, historical factors are postulated. Foreign species of the tribe Aphodiini seem to be more frequent in the northern localities where more aphodiine native species occur. In contrast, foreign species of the subfamily Scarabaeinae are not more frequent in the southern localities with a greater number of native scarabaeine species. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the more diverse assemblages of native dung beetle are more resistant to invasion by foreign species.},

	abstract = {The decomposition of dung constitutes an ecosystem service of massive proportions. Previous studies addressing how it depends on individual invertebrate taxa have been focused on small spatial scales, neglecting the impact of large-scale factors like climate. Here, we use the concept of citizen science to quantify taxon-specific contributions to dung decomposition at the level of a nation. Young people across Finland manipulated the decomposer communities of cow pats, then measured changes in pat mass over the grazing season. In southern Finland most (90\%) of the cattle dung hitting pastures decomposed in just two months, whereas 1100 km to the north the corresponding fraction was smaller (74\%). Of the total invertebrate-caused decomposition (13\% of dung pat mass, independent of latitude), large tunneling dor beetles in the genus Geotrupes account for 61\%, hence removing dung twice as fast as do smaller dung-dwelling beetles and earthworms. Overall, this paper illustrates how ecologists may direct citizen scientists to implement massive ecological experiments. Compared to an approach based purely on professional scientists, we saved three-quarters of the costs. Ultimately, citizen science may offer a key tool for testing current ecological theories at relevant spatial scalesand for disseminating these theories in the process.},

Dung beetle diversity was lower in pastures than in forests. However, the total biomass of beetles at similarly-sized dung baits was frequently higher in pastures. Diversity loss followed structured patterns: (1) carrion and fruit feeding beetles were well represented (species number) in the forests but were largely absent from pastures; (2) large ball rollers and small fast tunnellers were present in forests but were absent from pastures; (3) large fast tunnellers and small slow tunnellers were poorly represented in pastures compared to forests but the few species that survived in pastures attained extremely high populations; and (4) each functional group in the species-poor pasture assemblages was divided almost equally into day and night active species. Substrate and habitat generalists that were present in both the forests and pastures were attracted to fruit and carrion in forested habitat but not in open pastures. In open habitats, flies and other insects may be the principal decomposers of decaying fruit and carrion.},

We investigated measures of diversity, richness, and functional composition for individual taxa in relation to the degree of disturbance, and verified whether dung beetles and butterflies showed congruent trends. 3. For butterflies, overall species richness increased with forest disturbance, but the richness of rare species decreased. Species diversity was uncorrelated with disturbance. 4. In dung beetles, species richness was unrelated to forest disturbance, but species diversity increased with forest disturbance. The richness of dung beetles in the telecoprid (roller) guild declined with forest disturbance. 5. There was no significant correlation between dung beetles and butterflies across sites for either species richness or species diversity. 6.

Mac Leish] and exotic eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) have recently been planted on Cerrado grasslands. The Cerrado is the second largest biome of Brazil and one of the most threatened savanna ecosystems. 3. Here, we use dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) to investigate the effects of the land-use changes associated to afforestation on Cerrado insect biodiversity. We sampled dung beetles in candeia (4- and 6-year-old) and eucalyptus plantations (1- and 4-year-old), natural candeia formations (candeiais), native grasslands and natural forests. 4. Dung beetle diversity in plantations was lower than in grasslands and forests, but was not different from diversity in natural candeiais. Candeia and 1-year-old eucalyptus plantations, grasslands and natural candeiais all had similar community composition, distinct from natural forests. Four-year-old eucalyptus plantations were intermediate between those two groups. Overall, afforestation was detrimental for dung beetles. 5. Differences between exotic and native plantations were only apparent in older plantations, and seemed to be due to differences associated to canopy openness rather than to the origin of the planted species. Candeia plantations were of better conservation value for open-area species (62\% species shared between grasslands and candeia plantation) whereas eucalyptus plantations were so for forest species (26\% species shared between forests and eucalyptus plantations). We recommend considering this result before deciding where to plant which species.},

	abstract = {1. Co-occurrence of 11 species of crepuscular-nocturnal medium-sized tunnelling dung beetles from two core functional groups that vary in their rate of dung burial was examined at a range of spatial and temporal scales to identify the likely extent to which competition for dung might affect the structure of beetle communities of subtropical pasture. 2. At the largest scale, clear seasonal co-occurrence and similar habitat preferences (soil type and vegetation associations) were found amongst the species. 3. Medium- and fine-scale distributions of the species were investigated across nine blocks of dung-baited traps dispersed over a 400 ha tract of open cattle pasture, on deep sandy soil in Natal, South Africa. Traps were baited overnight and cleared in the morning in two series of three successive days. 4. There was marked variation in mean numbers caught within and between each 3-day trapping period, and also between blocks in the total number of beetles (pooled over species) or individual species caught per block. The spatial relationship for total beetles between blocks persisted for several days, but not several weeks. 5. Significant intraspecific aggregation was apparent for all species at the medium spatial scale amongst individual pads and between blocks over the 400 ha, but at the finest spatial scale (within blocks) most species were randomly distributed on most occasions, irrespective of the abundance of the species. The actual level of aggregation was thus found to increase at higher spatial scales. 6. Pairwise species comparisons showed little or no positive association on the majority of occasions and negative pairwise associations were exceedingly rare. Positive association between the two functional groups was stronger, however, and positive species association at the community-wide level was evident on most occasions. 7. There was thus some evidence of independent spatial aggregation patterns amongst individual species on a medium spatial scale (400 ha), but not on a fine scale (100 m2). Intraspecific/functional group aggregation tended to be greater than interspecific/functional group aggregation at all scales of analysis. Despite this, beetle densities in a considerable proportion of pads in the field would indicate, based on previous experimental evidence, that significant levels of inter- and intraspecific/functional group competition for dung is likely to occur. Thus, the aggregative behaviour of species documented here is not predicted to significantly diminish the level of interspecific competition within and between the two functional groups in this system.},

These 'downstream' effects will be exacerbated if functionally important taxa are tightly linked with species threatened by extinction or population decline. We review the current evidence that such a scenario is currently playing out in the linked declines of persistently hunted mammal populations and the dung beetles communities (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) that depend on them for adult and larval food resources. Through a close evolutionary association, mammal assemblages have played a fundamental role in structuring extant dung beetle communities. Today many game mammal species' populations are severely depleted by subsistence or commercial hunting, especially in tropical forest systems. Multiple lines of evidence from temperate and tropical systems indicate that the regional-scale decline or extirpation of medium and large bodied mammal faunas can severely disrupt the diversity and abundance of dung beetle communities through alterations in the composition and availability of dung resources. These observed community disassemblies have significant short- and long-term implications for the maintenance of key ecosystem processes including nutrient recycling and secondary seed dispersal. Identifying the species- and community-level traits that buffer or exacerbate these species and functional responses is essential if we are to develop a better understanding of the cascading ecological consequences of hunting in tropical forests.},

We compared dung beetle assemblages (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) inside and outside of the Kruger National Park, which protects indigenous flora and fauna over a large area of savanna in the northeast lowlands of South Africa. Although it is contiguous with other reserves in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, parts of its border abut onto farmland. Some effects of differing land usage either side of this border were studied at the South African Wildlife College (24.541A degrees S 31.335A degrees E) and the nearby farming village of Welverdiend using dung beetle assemblage structure (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) as indicators. Samples were taken from gabbro-derived and granite-derived soils in open woody vegetation, both within the reserve and on adjoining farmland, using composite pig, elephant and cattle dung baits in the early rainy season (November 2009) and separate pig and elephant dung baits in the late rainy season (March 2010). Despite much higher large mammal density around Welverdiend, significantly greater species richness, abundance, and biomass of dung beetles were recorded in the reserve where mammal species diversity is greater and elephants produce much larger droppings than any mammal in the farmland. Assemblage structure also differed strongly between dung types, weather conditions on sample days, and season, but weakly between sampled soil types. These differences in assemblage structure were recorded over short distances as the sites in the reserve were only 3-4 km from those in farmland at Welverdiend.},

	abstract = {1 Throughout much of the tropics, habitat loss is increasing and intensifying on the unprotected land surrounding conservation areas. The influence of these land-use changes on biodiversity is poorly understood. This study used data on dung beetles, a taxonomic group widely acknowledged to be an effective ecological indicator of anthropogenic disturbance, to evaluate temporal changes in diversity inside a natural protected area. 2 Using data from quantitative sampling events over the last 35 years along with an exhaustive review of the information available in museums and the literature, we present evidence suggesting that the dung beetles community structure has shifted dramatically over time at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. 3 To date, 50 dung beetle species have been reported from La Selva. Of these, 10 (20\%) were consistently collected within the study timeframe while 21 species (42\%) were uncommon. Our results indicate a tendency toward decreasing species richness and changes in species composition over time. 4 Analysis of the community structure revealed a decrease in diversity (H′), an increase in dominance (D) and a decrease in evenness (J) over the 35-year period; all of which can be linked to an increase in the dominance of one species (Onthophagus acuminatus). These changes were also reflected in the proportional abundance of major species guilds. 5 Synthesis and applications. Despite the relatively low human impact within La Selva, this study suggests that the dung beetle community has changed as result of habitat loss in the surrounding landscape and the progressive increasing isolation of the reserve over the last 35 years. Our findings, together with studies of other biota in the reserve, indicate a worrying decline in the conservation value of La Selva in recent decades. This shift in the diversity and composition of native forest biota needs to be taken into account in future studies that continue to rely on La Selva as providing an intact baseline for comparative research. More importantly, we suggest that the size of the reserve may need to be increased if its ecological integrity is to be restored. This study provides further evidence that isolated protected areas may often fail to safeguard biodiversity in the long term, and that to be viable, conservation strategies urgently need to adopt a wider landscape perspective.},

	abstract = {In tropical regions where agricultural activities are limited, agroforestry is an alternative for both economic development and for the management and conservation of biodiversity. The potential role of different types of land use as reservoirs of dung beetle diversity in the wet tropical forest of the Pacific lowlands of Colombia is evaluated in three agroforestry systems that differ in canopy cover and the sowing density of crops associated with timber forest. Although total species richness was similar among land use types, differences related to the decrease in the abundance and biomass of the species were remarkable, and reflected in turn by the diversity and structure of the guilds. The general pattern observed was one in which the structure of the dung beetle assemblage of growing below a diversified and permanent tree cover was similar to that of the primary and secondary forest. Beetle diversity in management systems with less tree cover or a high sowing density of was lower and very similar to that of abandoned agricultural fields. This suggests that agroforestry systems can be viewed as valuable instruments for biodiversity management and conservation in the wet tropical forests of the Pacific lowlands and not just as substitutes for forest, though we must be aware that structural changes in the beetle community may in turn affect the ecological processes regulated by these insects in the agrosystems under study.},

Using the mark-recapture method, we studied the abundance and population structure of dung beetle species (Deltochilum mexicanum and Dichotomius satanas) over one year in a human-modified landscape in Mexico. We captured 1960 individuals with a net recapture rate of 11\%. Deltochilum mexicanum had a higher rate of recapture (14\%) than Dichotomius satanas (5\%). Annual variation in abundance was similar for both species, with maximum abundance occurring in summer and a marked reduction during winter. Deltochilum mexicanum was dominant inside the forest, and its abundance was influenced by vegetation cover, temperature, and humidity. Dichotomius satanas was more frequent outside the forest, and none of the considered environmental variables affected its abundance. The adult sex ratio of Deltochilum mexicanum was female-biased, whereas that of Dichotomius satanas was male-biased. The maximum estimated population size was similar for both species, but Deltochilum mexicanum had a higher number of new individuals and survival rate. Since species with different biological attributes presented a similar pattern of abundance and population structure, we conclude that environmental conditions are the main regulator of dung beetle populations in the human-modified landscape.},

In total, 223 specimens of the three species were recorded. On the basis of abundance, the dominant species was D. colonicus. A substantial percentage (31\% in September and 51\% in October) of dung pats remained on the surface, untouched by beetles. Most of the specimens observed (92\%) were found amassing dung in galleries. The dung accumulation capacity of D. colonicus varied from 5 to 135 g of dung (dry weight)/pair, whereas C. klugi sierrensis amassed an average of 24.3 +/- 8.5 g/pair and P. quadridens amassed an average of 12 +/- 2.5 g/pair. Based on dung burying efficiency, D. colonicus was considered the most beneficial of the three species in the study area.

Here we provide a comprehensive framework for analysing seasonal changes in species composition, richness and diversity in two local dung beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea: Aphodiidae, Geotrupidae, and Scarabaeidae) communities from Western Tuscany (Italy), in the Mediterranean ecoregion. We test whether, in this highly seasonal region, cumulative annual diversity is an oversimplification of well differentiated seasonal communities. Data were obtained through repeated standardised samples collected regularly over an entire year. We clearly identify different summer and winter communities at each site based on species composition and abundance. Seasonal richness and diversity values are different from the cumulative annual values, as a consequence of beta diversity between seasons, and some dung beetle species are identified as idiosyncratic of each particular season. Both ecological (niche partitioning) and biogeographical factors are suggested as drivers of these temporal variations. Thus, because local inventories of fauna that include records over long time periods actually reflect situations where coexistence and interactions are unlikely to occur, highly seasonal sites must be viewed as having temporally differentiated communities in order to reach feasible and reliable baselines for local diversity assessments.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity defines the variety of living organisms on this planet and is often quantified by the total number of species. However, species richness is insufficient in accounting for the differences in evolutionary history and the functions species contribute to the ecosystem. To address this shortcoming, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity are increasingly being quantified and studied to inform ecological theory and conservation prioritisation. For scleractinian reef corals, congruence, mismatch and complementarity among different biodiversity components remain unknown, but recently available trait and phylogenetic data provide a robust test of these relationships. Here, we examine the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of corals across a gradient of diversity in Singapore. Relationships among the biodiversity components at 25 reef sites are compared to identify patterns of mismatch or congruence for testing the precision of using one as a proxy for another. Furthermore, we examine community assembly of corals using null models derived from randomised community data. Our results show that correlations among biodiversity components are generally positive but weak, with species-dependent (non-abundance-weighted) metrics more strongly correlated with one another than species-independent (abundance-weighted) measures. No single biodiversity component could predict another precisely to be used as a reliable proxy for coral communities. Therefore, if trait diversity and evolutionary history were to be set as conservation targets, it is essential to maximise functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity explicitly when identifying areas or assemblages for management. Null models reveal the presence of more-than-expected similarities in trait combinations and evolutionary relationships among species in most reef communities. These findings suggest that environmental filtering under high levels of coastal development and sedimentation may be associated with coral community composition on Singapore’s reefs. Our approach provides new insights into the relationships between different components of coral diversity and has important applications for marine conservation planning.},

	abstract = {Habitat fragmentation can lead to major changes in community composition, but little is known about the dynamics of these changes, or how community trajectories are affected by the initial state of habitat maturity. We use four landscape‐scale experiments from different biogeographic regions to understand how plant community composition responds to fragmentation over decades. Within each experiment, we consider first whether plant communities in the most‐fragmented treatments diverge in composition from plant communities in the least‐fragmented treatments. Second, because communities embedded in different fragments may become more similar to one another over time (biotic homogenization), we asked whether beta diversity – compositional variation across space – declines among fragments over time. Third, we assessed whether fragmentation alters the degree to which temporal change in fragmented landscapes is due to ordered species losses and gains (nestedness) versus species replacements (turnover). For each of these three questions, we contrasted patterns of compositional change in mature communities following fragmentation (disassembly; n = 2 experiments) with patterns in newly‐developing plant communities in fragments cleared of vegetation (assembly; n = 2 experiments).
            In the two studies where communities were disassembling, community composition in the most‐fragmented habitats diverged from that in least‐fragmented habitats. Beta diversity within a fragmentation treatment did not change over time at any of the four sites. In all four experiments, temporal patterns of compositional change were due mostly to species turnover, although nestedness played a role in the least‐fragmented sites in two of the studies. Overall, the impacts on community composition varied among landscape experiments, and divergence may have been affected by the maturity of the plant community. Future comparisons across ecosystems that account for species identities (vs simply richness) will be critical for predicting the effects of fragmentation, managing mature plant communities in remnants, and restoring plant communities where habitat has been lost.},

Habitat corridors are considered an important feature of reserves because they facilitate movement of organisms between patches, thereby increasing species richness in those patches. Here we demonstrate that by increasing species richness inside target patches, corridors additionally benefit biodiversity in surrounding non-target habitat, a biodiversity “spillover” effect. Working in the world's largest corridor experiment, we show that increased richness extends for approximately 30\% of the width of the 1-ha connected patches, resulting in 10–18\% more vascular plant species around patches of target habitat connected by corridors than around unconnected but otherwise equivalent patches of habitat. Furthermore, corridor-enhanced spillover into non-target habitat can be predicted by a simple plant life-history trait: seed dispersal mode. Species richness of animal-dispersed plants in non-target habitat increased in response to connectivity provided by corridors, whereas species richness of wind-dispersed plants was unaffected by connectivity and increased in response to changes in patch shape—higher edge-to-interior ratio—created by corridors. Corridors promoted biodiversity spillover for native species of the threatened longleaf pine ecosystem being restored in our experiment, but not for exotic species. By extending economically driven spillover concepts from marine fisheries and crop pollination systems, we show how reconnecting landscapes amplifies biodiversity conservation both within and beyond reserve borders.},

	abstract = {Soil microorganisms play outsized roles in nutrient cycling, plant health, and climate regulation. Despite their importance, we have a limited understanding of how soil microbes are affected by habitat fragmentation, including their responses to conditions at fragment edges, or “edge effects.” To understand the responses of soil communities to edge effects, we analyzed the distributions of soil bacteria, archaea, and fungi in an experimentally fragmented system of open patches embedded within a forest matrix. In addition, we identified taxa that consistently differed among patch, edge, or matrix habitats (“specialists”) and taxa that showed no habitat preference (“nonspecialists”). We hypothesized that microbial community turnover would be most pronounced at the edge between habitats. We also hypothesized that specialist fungi would be more likely to be mycorrhizal than nonspecialist fungi because mycorrhizae should be affected more by different plant hosts among habitats, whereas specialist prokaryotes would have smaller genomes (indicating reduced metabolic versatility) and be less likely to be able to sporulate than nonspecialist prokaryotes. Across all replicate sites, the matrix and patch soils harbored distinct microbial communities. However, sites where the contrasts in vegetation and pH between the patch and matrix were most pronounced exhibited larger differences between patch and matrix communities and tended to have edge communities that differed from those in the patch and forest. There were similar numbers of patch and matrix specialists, but very few edge specialist taxa. Acidobacteria and ectomycorrhizae were more likely to be forest specialists, while Chloroflexi, Ascomycota, and Glomeromycota (i.e., arbuscular mycorrhizae) were more likely to be patch specialists. Contrary to our hypotheses, nonspecialist bacteria were not more likely than specialist bacteria to have larger genomes or to be spore-formers. We found partial support for our mycorrhizal hypothesis: arbuscular mycorrhizae, but not ectomycorrhizae, were more likely to be specialists. Overall, our results indicate that soil microbial communities are sensitive to edges, but not all taxa are equally affected, with arbuscular mycorrhizae in particular showing a strong response to habitat edges. In the context of increasing habitat fragmentation worldwide, our results can help inform efforts to maintain the structure and functioning of the soil microbiome.},

	abstract = {Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However, empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number qD, where q = 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number qD, q {\textgreater} 0) and present a unified approach for both individual-based (abundance) data and sample-based (incidence) data. Using this unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the first three Hill numbers: q = 0 (species richness), q = 1 (the exponential of Shannon's entropy index), and q = 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both rarefied and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and short-range extrapolation. For long-range extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value of q and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data generated from species abundance models and on data from large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical ants.},

“the abundance problem” (Chao et al., 2014, p. 46)
the two problems with using richness as a universal metric for biodiversity

“Incorporating abundance into a biodiversity index is critical for studies of many (but not all) aspects of ecosystem function, because rare species usually make little contribution to important measures of ecosystem function such as biomass, productivity, or nutrient retention (Schwartz et al. 2000).” (Chao et al., 2014, p. 46)

good arguement for why we should worry about our biodiversity metrics (simpson)

“On the other hand, rare species sometimes play key roles in ecosystem function (e.g., top predators; Terborgh et al. 2001) and are generally of greater conservation and management concern than are common ones (May 1988, Holsinger and Gottlieb 1991; but see Gaston and Fuller 2008).” (Chao et al., 2014, p. 46)

another justification (shannon)
“hey were first used in ecology by MacArthur (1965), developed by Hill (1973), and recently reintroduced to ecologists by Jost (2006, 2007).” (Chao et al., 2014, p. 46)
the timeline
“expressed in units of effective numbers of species:” (Chao et al., 2014, p. 46)
maybe answering my question of what metric outcomes classify as
“resampling (Walker et al. 2008, Ricotta et al. 2012)” (Chao et al., 2014, p. 47)
maybe worth trying
“These indices tend to be highly correlated with one another, are not always expressed in units that are intuitive, sensible, or that allow comparisons, and have sampling and statistical properties that have been poorly studied (Ghent 1991)” (Chao et al., 2014, p. 46)

	abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of ecological community dynamics and how they could be affected by environmental changes is important. Population dynamic models have well known ecological parameters that describe key characteristics of species such as the effect of environmental noise and demographic variance on the dynamics, the long-term growth rate, and strength of density regulation. These parameters are also central for detecting and understanding changes in communities of species; however, incorporating such vital parameters into models of community dynamics is challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate how generalized linear mixed models specified as intercept-only models with different random effects can be used to fit dynamic species abundance distributions. Each random effect has an ecologically meaningful interpretation either describing general and species-specific responses to environmental stochasticity in time or space, or variation in growth rate and carrying capacity among species. We use simulations to show that the accuracy of the estimation depends on the strength of density regulation in discrete population dynamics. The estimation of different covariance and population dynamic parameters, with corresponding statistical uncertainties, is demonstrated for case studies of fish and bat communities. We find that species heterogeneity is the main factor of spatial and temporal community similarity for both case studies.},

Accurately estimating the true richness from very small samples is challenging, in particular for highly diverse populations with many rare species. Depending on the application, different estimation strategies have been proposed that incorporate explicit or implicit assumptions about either the species distribution or about the sampling process. These methods are scattered across the literature, and an extensive overview of their assumptions, methodology, and performance is currently lacking.We comprehensively review and evaluate a variety of existing methods on real and simulated data with different compositions of rare and abundant species. Our evaluation shows that, depending on species composition, different methods provide the most accurate richness estimates. Simple methods based on the observed number of singletons yield accurate asymptotic lower bounds for several of the tested simulated species compositions, but tend to underestimate the true richness for heterogeneous populations and small samples containing 1\% to 5\% of the population. When the population size is known, upsampling (extrapolating) estimators such as PreSeq and RichnEst yield accurate estimates of the total species richness in a sample that is up to 10 times larger than the observed sample.Source code for data simulation and richness estimation is available at https://gitlab.com/rahmannlab/speciesrichness.},

	abstract = {Three metrics of species diversity – species richness, the Shannon index and the Simpson index – are still widely used in ecology, despite decades of valid critiques leveled against them. Developing a robust diversity metric has been challenging because, unlike many variables ecologists measure, the diversity of a community often cannot be estimated in an unbiased way based on a random sample from that community. Over the past decade, ecologists have begun to incorporate two important tools for estimating diversity: coverage and Hill diversity. Coverage is a method for equalizing samples that is, on theoretical grounds, preferable to other commonly used methods such as equal‐effort sampling, or rarefying datasets to equal sample size. Hill diversity comprises a spectrum of diversity metrics and is based on three key insights. First, species richness and variants of the Shannon and Simpson indices are all special cases of one general equation. Second, richness, Shannon and Simpson can be expressed on the same scale and in units of species. Third, there is no way to eliminate the effect of relative abundance from estimates of any of these diversity metrics, including species richness. Rather, a researcher must choose the relative sensitivity of the metric towards rare and common species, a concept which we describe as ‘leverage.' In this paper we explain coverage and Hill diversity, provide guidelines for how to use them together to measure species diversity, and demonstrate their use with examples from our own data. We show why researchers will obtain more robust results when they estimate the Hill diversity of equal‐coverage samples, rather than using other methods such as equal‐effort sampling or traditional sample rarefaction.},

	abstract = {A number of metrics for quantifying the amount of functional redundancy in a community have been proposed over the years. Two of the most popular metrics are based on comparing a taxonomic diversity measure with a generalized form of the same measure that accounts for functional dissimilarities between taxa. These two metrics express redundancy as either an absolute or relative difference between the taxonomic diversity measure and its generalized form. Because they express the amount of redundancy in a community in terms of raw diversity values, both redundancy metrics are susceptible to the same issues that complicate the interpretation of most commonly used diversity indices. It is possible to overcome these issues by restating these two indices using a Hill numbers framework. As a growing number of authors have noted, these modified metrics provide a more intuitive quantitative definition of functional redundancy when used to rank communities. Beyond this intuitive definition, measuring redundancy in terms of Hill numbers allows researchers to control the influence of rare taxa on the output value, enabling ecologists to better predict how a community is expected to respond when exposed to an external perturbation that selectively eliminates rare or common taxa. Here I show that, of the two possible Hill number-based redundancy metrics, the form based on a popular absolute redundancy metric is extremely sensitive to differences in taxonomic diversity and can provide a misleading picture of how much redundancy is present in a community. For this reason, I argue that Hill number-based functional redundancy should be quantified using a relative metric that explicitly accounts for differences in effective taxonomic diversity. The proposed Hill number-based relative redundancy measure is shown to provide a much more complete picture of the distribution of redundant taxa within a community, highlighting subtle patterns that are completely missed by the Hill number-based absolute redundancy metric. I include open-source R code for calculating the indices discussed here. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract The literature on effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity is huge. It is also very diverse, with different authors measuring fragmentation in different ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat. Results of empirical studies of habitat fragmentation are often difficult to interpret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity. Habitat fragmentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the influence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two components of fragmentation must be measured independently. More studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se are needed to determine the factors that lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per se. I suggest that the term “fragmentation” should be reserved for the breaking apart of habitat, independent of habitat loss.},

It may be possible in many cases to reduce the adverse "island" effects by linking adjacent protected areas with wildlife corridors. Wildlife corridors are defined in this paper as habitat that permits the movement of organisms between ecological isolates. Corridors should be designed for those species within a protected area that are considered to be most vulnerable to extinction. For these species knowledge about the habitat requirements, dispersal, seasonal movements, avoidance behavior, and learning behavior are important for the design of wildlife corridors. The ability of a species to successfully use a corridor is dependent in part upon the width and length of the corridor. In most cases, the determination of the minimum corridor width will be an empirical calculation. Many of the practical challenges of designing wildlife corridors are examined by presenting examples of proposed wildlife corridors in the Eastern Usambara Mountains and on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.},

While the implications of landscape connectivity are self-evident for conservation, they are also important for physical geography since a proper understanding of landscape patterns and processes allows for better landscape management practices, which are at the core of geography. This paper presents a review of the literature based on 162 publications from 2000 to 2013, in which we evaluated the current state and recent advances in the integration of landscape connectivity in the identification and planning of conservation areas. The literature review and data analysis were based on a database organized into five categories: General information, study areas, research objectives, research methods in connectivity studies, and integration of connectivity with conservation. We found a substantial increase in the number of publications relating to connectivity and conservation from 2008 to 2013. Least cost analysis was the method most commonly applied. We found no implementation of landscape connectivity proposals generated by the studies (e.g. potential corridors) into real landscape elements to ensure the permanence and functionality of ecosystems. We identified four important niches for potential future research projects: a) connectivity and climate change, b) contribution of connectivity studies to restoration planning, c) connectivity and land cover/land use change modeling and planning, d) contribution of connectivity analysis in the provision of ecosystem services across landscapes.},

	abstract = {Land conversion due to human activities produces distinctive spatial patterns across the landscape. It remains unclear, however, how particular spatial arrangements of remnant habitat patches influence species persistence. We present a conceptual model of landscape change that focuses explicitly on habitat spatial arrangement. Four sequences, characterized as shrinkage, bisection, fragmentation, and perforation, differ qualitatively in the spatial arrangement of intact habitat and differ quantitatively in boundary length, amount of interior area, and connectivity. We tested the predictions of this conversion sequence model in a "microlandscape" field experiment with insects in a native grassland habitat. The four conversion sequences significantly influenced the species composition of the above-ground insect community, and insect species groups varied in their responses. Four patterns were evident from the field experiment: (1) as habitat decreased, insect density rose sharply on small dispersed patches of the bisection and fragmentation sequences, an effect less evident in the large remnant patch of the shrinkage sequence; (2) species richness declined only in the case of shrinkage, whereas richness increased in the fragmentation sequence; (3) most individual species examined responded similarly to the community as a whole; and (4) large rare species were concentrated in remaining habitat of the shrinkage and fragmentation sequences. Overall, the shrinkage and perforation sequences, which had high connectivity, were similar to one another in species composition, while the bisection and fragmentation sequences, which had low connectivity, were similar to one another. Based on these results, we conclude that a spatial pattern of land conversion that maintains one or more large, closely spaced remnant patches of native vegetation is essential for species persistence.},

	abstract = {In flying organisms, wing shape and biomechanical properties are recognized as key traits related to dispersal, foraging behavior, sexual selection and habitat preferences. To determine if differences in dung beetle wing shape and flight biomechanics are consistent with habitat preferences in a phylogenetic context, we examined how wing morphology varied in a set of 18 Mozambique forest and grassland dung beetle (Scarabaeinae) species, representing nine genera and six tribes. Geometric morphometric measurements were taken of entire wings, as well as two additional shape characters comprising the RA4 and CuA to J regions of veins. Ordination (Principal Components Analysis and Canonical Variate Analysis) of landmark data revealed three different trends in wing shape related to expansion or contraction in external wing margins. These trends were consistent with published dung beetle phylogenies and a phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral morphological changes using parsimony analysis of wing landmark configurations. Analysis of variance showed that the Procrustes distances between wing shapes were significantly correlated to species identity ({\textasciitilde} 48\% of variance), wing size ({\textasciitilde} 27\%), habitat ({\textasciitilde} 11\%) and two of the three, tested, biomechanical variables (wing loading, wing aspect ratio: {\textasciitilde} 1\%). However, while a phylogenetic generalized least squares analysis confirmed a strongly significant phylogenetic signal for wing shape, it found no significant effect of any other variable. Therefore, wing shape evolution in dung beetles appears to have been phylogenetically constrained and habitat may constitute only a weak selective pressure for changes in wing shape.},

Of the 3,136 beetles collected, 11 species were represented: Onthophagus taurus Schreber, O. pennsylvanicus Harold, O. hecate hecate Panzer, Copris minutus Drury, Phanaeus vindex MacLeay, Dichotomius carolinus L., Sphaeridium scarabaeoides L., Aphodius erraticus L., A. fimetarius L., A.

The most common species found in both years was O. taurus, which accounted for 43\% and 59\% of the populations in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Paracoprid tunneler beetles dominated the collection in both years. Both native and exotic species were abundant, indicating that the introduction of exotic dung beetle species has not been detrimental to native populations. The species abundance and diversity fluctuated throughout the summer, likely related to weather patterns.},

Dung beetles are the primary group of insects responsible for dung turnover, and factors affecting their abundance and distribution thus impact dung degradation. Lands lost to grazing due to dung buildup and pasture contamination total millions of acres per year in US pastures. We evaluated the structural differences in dung beetle assemblages in natural grasslands versus a managed agroecosystem in subtropical southeastern Florida (USA). We measured the direct effect of dung longevity when dung beetle fauna normally inhabiting dung pats were excluded. Our results indicate dung beetle abundance, functional diversity, and species richness have a substantial impact on the rate of dung turnover in subtropical pastoral lands with 70\% of dung removed from the soil surface after three months. Functional diversity and evenness did not have a significant positive effect on dung removal in managed, versus natural grasslands demonstrating a strong relationship between dung beetle assemblage composition and delivery of a key ecological process, dung degradation. We suggest the importance of trees, which provide a thermal refuge for beetles, should be dispersed within matrixes of open pasture areas and within proximity to adjacent closed-canopy hammocks to facilitate the exchange of dung beetles between habitats and therefore maintain the provisioning of dung degradation services by dung beetle assemblages.},

	abstract = {Given current accelerated trends of tropical land conversion, forest fragments are being incorporated into many conservation programs. For investing in fragments to be a viable conservation strategy, forest fragments must maintain their ecological integrity over the long term. Based on fieldwork in 22 forest fragments in the crater lakes region of western Uganda and in the continuous forest of Kibale National Park, we examined (1) seed predation on experimentally dispersed seeds, (2) abundance and composition of the dung beetle community that may play a major role in removing seeds from sites of high seed predation, and (3) compared the fragments' seedling community composition to adult tree community composition and the seedling community in continuous forest. First, the rate of seed removal at experimental stations was lower in forest fragments (85\% remaining after 1 day) than at stations in the continuous forest (79\% remaining) and the probability of stations being discovered by seed predators was lower in fragments (23\%) than in the intact forest (41\%). Second, there was a 62 percent decline in fragment dung beetle abundance. The magnitude of this decline varied among dung beetle guilds that process dung and seeds in different fashions. The abundance of large rollers that move large seeds away from sites of defecation did not differ, but medium and smaller rollers and burying beetles that process small and medium-sized seeds were less common in the fragments than in the intact forest. Finally, we compared the seedling community composition relative to adult tree community composition by identifying all adult trees in each fragment and by sampling the composition of the seedling community. We found some evidence to suggest that there was movement of seeds among forest fragments by large-bodied dispersers, particularly chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and hornbills (Ceratogymna subcylindricus).},

	abstract = {Reversing anthropogenic impacts on habitat structure is frequently successful through restoration, but the mechanisms linking habitat change, community reassembly and recovery of ecosystem functioning remain unknown. We test for the influence of edge effects and matrix habitat restoration on the reassembly of dung beetle communities and consequent recovery of dung removal rates across tropical forest edges. Using path modelling, we disentangle the relative importance of community-weighted trait means and functional trait dispersion from total biomass effects on rates of dung removal. Community trait composition and biomass of dung beetle communities responded divergently to edge effects and matrix habitat restoration, yielding opposing effects on dung removal. However, functional dispersion—used in this study as a measure of niche complementarity—did not explain a significant amount of variation in dung removal rates across habitat edges. Instead, we demonstrate that the path to functional recovery of these altered ecosystems depends on the trait-mean composition of reassembling communities, over and above purely biomass-dependent processes that would be expected under neutral theory. These results suggest that any ability to manage functional recovery of ecosystems during habitat restoration will demand knowledge of species' roles in ecosystem processes.},

Few such studies have been carried out under realistic levels of diversity in the field, particularly in high diversity ecosystems such as tropical forests. 2 We used exclusion experiments to study the effects of dung beetle functional group richness and composition on two interlinked and functionally important ecological processes, dung removal and secondary seed dispersal, in evergreen tropical forest in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. 3 Overall, both dung and seed removal increased with dung beetle functional group richness. However, levels of ecosystem functioning were idiosyncratic depending on the identity of the functional groups present, indicating an important role for functional group composition. There was no evidence for interference or competition among functional groups. 4 We found strong evidence for overyielding and transgressive overyielding, suggesting complementarity or facilitation among functional groups. Not all mixtures showed transgressive overyielding, so that complementarity was restricted to particular functional group combinations. 5 Beetles in a single functional group (large nocturnal tunnellers) had a disproportionate influence on measures of ecosystem function: in their absence dung removal is reduced by approximately 75\%. However, a full complement of functional groups is required to maximize ecosystem functioning. 6 This study highlights the importance of both functional group identity and species composition in determining the ecosystem consequences of extinctions or altered patterns in the relative abundance of species.},

In this context, working with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming. We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature. Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.},

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the scientific literature linking direct drivers of change and ecosystem services via functional traits of three taxonomic groups (vegetation, invertebrates, and vertebrates) to: (1) uncover trends and research biases in this field; and (2) synthesize existing empirical evidence. Our results show the existence of important biases in published studies related to ecosystem types, taxonomic groups, direct drivers of change, ecosystem services, geographical range, and the spatial scale of analysis. We found multiple evidence of links between drivers and services mediated by functional traits, particularly between land-use changes and regulating services in vegetation and invertebrates. Seventy-five functional traits were recorded in our sample. However, few of these functional traits were repeatedly found to be associated with both the species responses to direct drivers of change (response traits) and the species effects on the provision of ecosystem services (effect traits). Our results highlight the existence of potential “key functional traits,” understood as those that have the capacity to influence the provision of multiple ecosystem services, while responding to specific drivers of change, across a variety of systems and organisms. Identifying “key functional traits” would help to develop robust indicator systems to monitor changes in biodiversity and their effects on ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services supply.},

This has resulted in a steady, nonasymptotic increase in diversity, with nearly 14\% more species in connected fragments after almost two decades. Our results show that the full biodiversity value of connectivity is much greater than previously estimated, cannot be effectively evaluated at short time scales, and can be maximized by connecting habitat sooner rather than later.},

Shifting phenologies and mismatches between species may affect range limits and lead to extinctions and biodiversity loss, which are especially concerning in ecologically and economically important SCs like coprophilous beetles. This study provides phenological data for many species of coprophilous beetles from the Midwestern region of the US, includes the often-missing winter months, and compares the seasonal and successional differences between the “relocator” and “dweller” guilds. Beetles were sampled biweekly throughout the year from a 3.8 ha Farm in Adrian, SE-Michigan using 15 pitfall traps baited with cow manure. Samples were collected after 48 h and again after 72 h exposure time. Over the entire year, I caught 6069 specimens from 24 species of Scarabaeoidea and 13 species of Hydrophilidae. The ROSARIO null model for continuous temporal data suggested a significant seasonal overlap of the SC (p \&lt; 0.0001) and a cluster analysis based on Pianka’s niche overlap index identified five clusters at a minimum overlap of 55 \% falling into three major phenological guilds. “Relocators” (6 Scarabaeinae, 2 Aphodiinae species) overlapped on average by 48.4 \%, whereas “dwellers” (9 Aphodiinae, 10 Hydrophilidae species) overlapped by 36.0 \% (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.055). Small Hydrophilidae dwellers overlapped by 30.9 \% whereas large hydrophilid dwellers overlapped by 96.9 \%. Individual phenological patterns were compared to other sites in North America and Europe and predictions about geographical and phenological changes due to the man-made climate crisis and habitat loss and fragmentation are discussed. Differences between the seasonal overlaps of “relocators” and “dwellers” as well as small and large Onthophagus relocators and Hydrophilidae dwellers are suggesting profound ecological differences between the guilds and sub-guilds.},

Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize ‘best-practice’ data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

	abstract = {Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However, empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number qD, where q = 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number qD, q {\textgreater} 0) and present a unified approach for both individual-based (abundance) data and sample-based (incidence) data. Using this unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the first three Hill numbers: q = 0 (species richness), q = 1 (the exponential of Shannon's entropy index), and q = 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both rarefied and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and short-range extrapolation. For long-range extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value of q and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data generated from species abundance models and on data from large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical ants.},

Changes in the landscape resulting from habitat fragmentation and changes in land use systems serve as a filter for surface and soil beetle community composition, as the most tolerant species, are able to remain in the environment while others that are less tolerant may disappear. This study aimed to assess the community composition of ground-dwelling beetles and their relationship with environmental variables in fragments of the subtropical landscape in southern Brazil. Hence, evaluations of morphospecies and ecomorphological traits of ground-dwelling beetles in three municipalities were used. In each landscape, a sampling grid was established within a window with 1 km diameter and two sampling periods (autumn and winter) were performed for ground-dwelling beetles, soil attributes, litter, and spatial variables. There was an increase of individuals in the fragments with forest systems and with greater soil cover. The beetle communities of the native forest differed from those of pasture, crop-livestock integration, and no-tillage. The hemiedaphic and epigeous life-forms were associated with eucalyptus plantation and shrub vegetation, respectively. The native forest favored beetles with larger body sizes, compared to pasture, no-tillage, and eucalyptus plantation systems. The functional diversity (FD) and Simpson's indices were similar throughout the landscape. The environmental variables (Macropores, Soil Nitrogen, Aeration Space, Perimeter of the fragments, Litter Dry Weight) showed a relationship with several morphospecies but despite that they explained only a small part of the community structure. The heterogeneity of land use systems in subtropical landscapes was a driver of changes in the composition of ground-dwelling beetle communities and ecomorphological traits.},

Discrimination between sandy soils with three different loam contents (0\%, 20\%, 40\%) and four different water contents (4\%, 8\%, 12\%, 16\%) was tested in the laboratory. During the first 24 h of each replicate beetles which colonized one of the patches did not distinguish between different soil conditions. Emigration rates, measured as time when 50\% of all individuals had left the patch, and numbers of brood chambers proved to be species specific and depended on soil moisture and soil type. Survival rates of the larvae in the brood chambers were influenced nearly exclusively by soil moisture. The results are discussed in relation to the ecology of the three species and in context with optimal foraging theories.},

This paper reports substantial ecological variation within a set of Aphodius dung beetles occurring in the same patchily distributed resource, livestock dung in pastures. We show how variation in habitat and resource selectivity, in the rate of movements between pastures, and in the distribution of local population sizes all contribute to interspecific differences in spatial population structures. Local dung beetle assemblages are compared between two landscapes with different densities of pastures. In one of the landscapes, we contrast the abundances and regional distributions of Aphodius before and after 15 years of rapid habitat loss. Different species show very dissimilar responses to changes in the structure of the landscape. Our results suggest that generalist Aphodius species, and specialist species with high dispersal powers, occur as large "patchy" populations in the landscape. In contrast, a strict pasture specialist species with limited dispersal powers (A. pusillus) forms classical metapopulations. At the community level, interspecific differences in spatial population structures make the local community composition a function of the structure of the surrounding landscape.},

	abstract = {A large-scale “experiment” was undertaken in a 100 000 ha region of south-eastern Australia to examine the response of mammals to landscape context, habitat fragmentation and other factors. The investigation examined the presence and abundance of mammals in three broad categories of sites for which there were strong contrasts in the composition of the surrounding landscape:•Large contiguous areas of Eucalyptus forest,•Areas dominated by exotic plantation softwood Radiata Pine (Pinus radiata) trees, and•Fragments of eucalypt forest surrounded by an extensive P. radiata plantation.These sites provided the basis for assessing the effects of what we term “landscape context”. Eighty-six fragments of remnant eucalypt forest of varying size, shape, isolation age and other attributes were selected by a stratified, randomization process. Forty sites were located in large contiguous areas of Eucalyptus forest and these were matched to the sites in the remnants on the basis of forest type, geology and climatic conditions. A further 40 sites were selected in areas dominated by P. radiata trees and these also were matched to sites in the remnants and those in large contiguous areas of native forest on the basis of geology and climatic conditions. Two major surveys sampled mammals in the study. Hairtubing (a technique for detecting animals from the analysis of fur collected in a small portable bait station) was utilized at all 166 sites selected in the study. Trapping and a combination of different types of hairtubing was then employed at a subset of 58 sites. Data from these surveys was used to investigate the response of mammals to landscape context, habitat fragmentation and other attributes. A sub-theme of the study was to assess the efficacy of different methods to count mammals. There were large differences in the effectiveness of the different field techniques. The best technique (best in the sense of counting most animals) varied between species, particularly in relation to body size. Trapping and smaller-sized hairtubes were superior for small mammals such as Brown Antechinus (Antechinus stuartii) and Bush Rat (Rattus fuscipes). Large hairtubes performed best in the detection of large mammals like the Common Wombat (Vombatus ursinus), Common and Mountain Brushtail Possums (Trichosurus vulpecula and Trichosurus caninus), and Swamp Wallaby (Wallabia bicolor). W. bicolor and V. ursinus showed no response to landscape context and were detected at similar rates in the remnants, sites in large contiguous areas of native forest and sites dominated by stands of P. radiata. Trichosurus spp. were recorded significantly less often in sites dominated by P. radiata trees. Landscape context effects for R. fuscipes and A. stuartii varied depending on the field methods employed to sample mammals. However, in general, R. fuscipes and A. stuartii were recorded significantly less frequently in P. radiata sites than sites in large contiguous areas of Eucalyptus forest or fragments of remnant eucalypt forest surrounded by the softwood plantation. An important finding of our work was that although some species were extremely rare in P. radiata stands, no significant differences were identified in mammal presence and abundance between sites located in large contiguous areas of Eucalyptus forest and sites in fragments of remnant eucalypt forest surrounded by the softwood plantation. This finding suggests that either: animals from potential population sources in contiguous eucalypt forest can move through the softwood plantation and colonise the remnants, or populations residing in the fragments of remnant eucalypt forest are large enough to resist local extinction. Softwood plantations are presently being expanded in south-eastern Australia, particularly on semi-cleared farmland that supports remnant fragments of native Eucalyptus forest and woodland. Our findings indicate that remnant native forest within plantations of exotic P. radiata trees are occupied by several species of native mammals even when these fragments are surrounded by extensive, largely unsuitable plantation forests that have been established for many decades. These fragments should not be cleared during efforts to expand the softwood plantation estate. Large remnants and those with particular habitat features such as a dense cover of vegetation should have priority for exemption from clearing.},

We find that forest landscapes in the tropics were relatively intact, yet these areas experienced the most severe fragmentation over the past two decades. In contrast, 75.1\% of the world’s forests experienced a decrease in fragmentation, and forest fragmentation in most fragmented temperate and subtropical regions, mainly in northern Eurasia and South China, declined between 2000 and 2020. We also identify eight modes of fragmentation that indicate different recovery or degradation states. Our findings underscore the need to curb deforestation and increase connectivity among forest fragments, especially in tropical areas.},
