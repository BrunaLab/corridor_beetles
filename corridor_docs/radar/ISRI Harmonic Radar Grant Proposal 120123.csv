2131428,"Vibrating tube sensors:  A versatile and low-cost instrument for continuously monitoring the mass, volume, and density of any microgram-sized biosample in fluid",DBI,Innovation: Instrumentation,2/1/22,1/21/22,William Grover,CA,University of California-Riverside,Standard Grant,Eric Lyons,1/31/25,"$334,982.00 ",,wgrover@engr.ucr.edu,200 UNIVERSTY OFC BUILDING,RIVERSIDE,CA,925210001,9518275535,BIO,165Y00,,$0.00 ,"An award is made to the University of California, Riverside, to develop a versatile and low-cost instrument for continuously monitoring the mass, volume, and density of any microgram-sized biosample in fluid.  To maximize involvement of students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields (students who represent nearly half of the student body of UC Riverside), the project includes a program that will give 20 undergraduates the opportunity to assist with building beta versions of the proposed instrument for testing by bioscience collaborators. This valuable career-readiness training will contribute to the development of a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce. Additionally, by developing an open-source bioinstrument design suitable for replication by other researchers and future commercial production, the project will enhance the nation?s research infrastructure and lay the foundations for future partnerships between academia and industry.<br/><br/>Measurements of the mass of an object are ubiquitous throughout the sciences. But in the biosciences, many of the objects studied?like cells, microorganisms, fish embryos, insect larvae, sprouting seeds, hydrogels, oral pharmaceuticals, and many more?reside in a liquid environment. This makes it difficult or impossible to accurately measure the mass of these biosamples using conventional tools like laboratory balances. In addition, the masses of many biosamples change in meaningful ways?an organism gains mass as it grows, a biodegradable material loses mass as it dissolves away, and so on?and accurately monitoring these mass changes over time is very labor-intensive. To address these gaps in biologists? ability to capture observations of biological phenomena, this project will develop and disseminate a free and open-source design for an instrument capable of automatically monitoring the mass, volume, and density of any microgram-sized biosample, in any desired liquid, with nanogram-scale resolution.  The instrument utilizes a vibrating tube sensor, a simple piece of glass tubing vibrated at its resonance frequency. By passing a millimeter-sized biosample in fluid through this sensor, the mass of the sample is recorded as a change in the sensor?s resonance frequency. The instrument development process will be guided by feedback from a diverse set of five beta-testing bioscience research labs at UC Riverside who will use the instrument in toxicology, biomaterials, drug delivery, entomology, and plant science research. The result will be a low-cost and easy-to-use instrument design that any bioscience researcher can replicate and use to monitor any suitably sized biosample, in any liquid, in a fully automated manner, over any desired timescale.  This will give a diverse community of bioscience researchers a tool that not only supports and accelerates their existing research but also opens up whole new techniques and areas of inquiry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2117782,"MRI: Development of a fully automated, 1,000-MicroChemostat microfluidic system for parallel, independent, long-duration, machine-guided experiments",DBI,"Major Research Instrumentation, Innovation: Instrumentation",10/1/21,7/19/24,John Wikswo,TN,Vanderbilt University,Standard Grant,Jennifer Weller,9/30/25,"$999,810.00 ","John McLean, Eric Spivey, Megan Behringer",john.wikswo@vanderbilt.edu,110 21ST AVE S,NASHVILLE,TN,372032416,6153222631,BIO,"118900, 165Y00",,$0.00 ,"An award is made to Vanderbilt University to develop Genesis, a fully automated microfluidic system containing 1,000 microchemostats for parallel, independent, long-duration, machine-guided experiments to study microbial cells. Microbes such as the baker?s and brewer?s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are expected to play an ever-increasing role in the production of vaccines, cancer therapies and other pharmaceuticals, food protein, and feedstock for the chemical industry, and sequestration of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, all areas of pressing societal need. Genesis will use machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to serve as a ?robot scientist? or ?self-driving laboratory? to accelerate the development of mathematical models that describe microbial metabolism and growth. These will help us understand, and possibly optimize, for example, the interactions between the many different microbial species that comprise the human microbiome and contribute to both health and disease. The ability of Genesis to create computational models of cellular signaling and metabolism on its own should advance medicine, biotechnology, and fundamental biological knowledge, since such models are required to optimize experiments and interpret data to reveal the rules that govern biological processes. The Genesis project will involve three established research and training programs at Vanderbilt, all of which are active in the recruitment and involvement of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral trainees in their research projects. Genesis offers a breadth of very attractive technical challenges and scientific and social opportunities ideal for interdisciplinary research training in AI, swarm robotics, machine learning, the exploration of signaling and metabolic pathways in microbes and suspended mammalian cells, and addressing how the complexity of biology could in fact be utilized to solve societal problems in nutrition, health, and medicine. Genesis will allow scientists and engineers and their trainees to address a number of important scientific, commercial, and societal problems by advancing our understanding of biology and disease and improving the efficiency of industrial production of biochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Genesis also provides additional impact as a tool for classroom instruction, in that ultimately it will allow students to pose questions and ask Genesis to design and conduct the experiments needed to answer them. Genesis will be designed to be mass produced at low cost, so that small laboratories could afford a small-scale system.<br/><br/>In common use, yeast does its work in batches, where it grows and multiplies until it runs out of food or creates an environment where it can no longer thrive. A small batch of yeast grown in a research laboratory might require a milliliter of growth media in one well of a multi-well plate, whereas a yeast bioreactor at a pharmaceutical company could hold a few thousand liters, and one in a brewery a million liters. As an alternative to batches, a continuous-flow bioreactor, termed a chemostat, provides a steady supply of food and continuously removes excess yeast or even suspended mammalian cells and their metabolites to maintain steady-state growth. There is a growing recognition that chemostats can provide reproducible, reliable, and biologically homogeneous datasets that are well suited for probing the metabolism and signaling of living cells. However, the application of ?self-driving? and machine-learning technologies to advancing biological knowledge will benefit from a thousand or more chemostats operating in parallel under computer control. Neither commercial production nor research chemostats have the correct combination of size, cost, and automated instrumentation. The Genesis system will address this need by using state-of-the-art, multi-channel microfluidic pumps and valves to control all of the microchemostats over a wide range of conditions with different strains of yeast, swarm robots to move 48 microchemostats at a time, and very high-throughput mass spectrometers to make a broad metabolic measurement every 10 or 15 seconds that will generate terabytes of data that exceed the ability of humans to control, process, and interpret. The resulting computational models could have thousands of equations. Genesis will provide, for the first time, an efficient means to design and conduct the massive number of biological experiments needed to parameterize, validate, and utilize these models to probe and even control biological systems for specific applications. Projects that will be pursued as soon as Genesis is operational include basic research in cell signaling and metabolism, quantitative explorations of the metabolomic interactions of co-cultured bacterial species that together could produce protein for food and chemical feedstocks, tracking multiple, parallel evolutionary histories to determine which environmental and genetic factors are important for the evolution of microbial cooperation, and improved methods to use mammalian cells to produce therapeutic antibodies. The parallel development of two Genesis instruments, one funded by NSF and the other by the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, integrates Vanderbilt?s expertise in microfluidics and mass spectrometry with Chalmers? expertise in AI, machine learning, and yeast to create a pair of robot scientists that will accelerate inquiries into the rules of life and the discovery of new solutions to some of society?s pressing problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
2450351,Development and Optimization of a Digital AC-DC Electropenetrograph for Real-Time Recording of On-host Tick Feeding,DBI,Innovation: Instrumentation,9/1/24,9/20/24,Kathryn Reif,AL,Auburn University,Continuing Grant,Eric Lyons,9/30/26,"$563,886.00 ",,kreif@vet.k-state.edu,321-A INGRAM HALL,AUBURN,AL,368490001,3348444438,BIO,165Y00,,$0.00 ,"An award is made to Kansas State University (in collaboration with USDA Agricultural Research Service and Harvey Mudd College) to design, build, and test a digital AC-DC electropenetrograph to study the real-time feeding behaviors of blood-feeding arthropods, using ticks as the model system. Ticks and other blood-feeding arthropods transmit a wide array of medically- and veterinary-important pathogens, many of these increasingly exacerbated by climate change. An important obstacle to basic research on tick feeding behavior is the inability to capture observations and statistically analyze details of tick feeding behavior because it is masked below the surface of the host?s skin. The challenge is further compounded by the incredibly long durations over which ticks feed (~7 to 10 days for adult ticks). To address this methodological deficit, this project will develop a user- and application-friendly digital AC-DC electropenetrograph which will enable researchers to readily investigate these hidden behaviors in unprecedented detail. This project brings together a transdisciplinary team of scientists that will collectively support the training of 12 to 20 undergraduates and a postdoctoral researcher, giving them opportunities to explore this burgeoning area of research interest from diverse perspectives of engineering, computer science, and biology. Project undergraduates and the postdoctoral researcher will work in teams mentored and guided by project scientists. Trainees, recruited as broadly as possible, will interact with scientists from academia, government, and industry, affording them opportunities to investigate future career paths. Trainees will be involved in both intellectual and physical aspects of this research and will participate in the iterative evaluation of their designs tested using a combination of arthropod species: ticks (project model blood-feeding arthropod) and aphids (gold standard insect for electropenetrography research). Project scientists and trainees will also have opportunity to share project goals with broader audiences through development and delivery of related content and experiential opportunities through community and science communication engagement platforms and events (e.g. Kansas Science Fair).<br/><br/>Electropenetrography (EPG) is a transformational technology that has been used for nearly 65 years to study the masked feeding behaviors of piercing-sucking, plant-feeding insects. However, such a means of studying the basic behaviors of blood-feeding arthropods in real time, including ticks that feed for extreme durations (days to weeks), has eluded biologists for decades. Despite initial success with tick and mosquito feeding recordings using the existing analog AC-DC electropenetrograph, this instrumentation presents notable physical limitations for working with blood-feeding arthropods on vertebrate hosts. Developing a more user- and application-friendly digital AC-DC electropenetrograph will solve this challenge and enable ground-breaking investigations to detect, characterize, and quantify the progressive and highly coordinated feeding behaviors performed by ticks and other blood-feeding arthropods. Hypothesis-driven studies can then be performed to study basic feeding biology and investigate how host factors, vector characteristics, pathogens, and chemical interventions specifically modify hidden arthropod blood-feeding behaviors. In this project, the digital AC-DC electropenetrograph will be evaluated over the course of three scientific objectives: (i) Design and build a prototype digital AC-DC electropenetrograph and associated software to record tick feeding on an unsedated live host; (ii) Iteratively evaluate versions of the prototype instrument with live ticks and live host, and modify prototype as needed; and, (iii) Demonstrate the usability of the digital AC-DC electropenetrograph to record and statistically compare tick feeding behaviors upon applications of a behavior-interdicting compound. Successful completion of this research will deliver a user-friendly, commercializable instrument and associated software that will: 1) accelerate expansion of electropenetrography from plant-feeding insects into blood-feeding arthropods, 2) ensure the continued availability of this crucial infrastructure through an evolved digital instrument design, and 3) allow faster high-throughput uses through development-associated machine learning software.  Project outcomes will include development of a user-friendly, digital AC-DC electropenetrograph and supporting ?arthropod species flexible? software. This novel research instrument will spur new opportunity for a broad community of researchers interested in improving the resiliency of animal and plant agriculture from blood-feeding and plant feeding arthropods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lactate plays many key roles in the body, including as a stress response signal, a fuel source, a signaling molecule and an indication of reaching maximum oxygen consumption during exercise or reaching the limit of aerobic diving in marine mammals. Despite its importance, lactate has never been continuously measured in freely-moving animals. With this device, which will also measure oxygen, glucose and temperature, researchers can continuously measure lactate and other variables in active, resting, diving or hibernating animals in the field or under controlled laboratory conditions. This new device will eliminate the impacts of having an investigator present since the implantable probe can be attached to a backpack recorder, allowing free movement of animals. The project will foster interdisciplinary collaborations between bioengineers and biologists from three different institutions and provide interdisciplinary scientific training for Ph.D. and undergraduate students and a postdoctoral fellow.  Using the development of this device as a teaching tool, this project will provide unique training through a summer course on instrument development for underserved high school students in partnership with a non-profit organization.  <br/><br/>This innovation project will use specialized chemical formulations and light sensing technology to develop a 0.7 mm diameter, flexible probe that provides highly accurate, rapid and continuous measurements of key parameters, including lactate and glucose. Because each sensor is based on the same measurement design, users can choose sensors specific to their research questions, providing the flexibility required for a device that will be used by a wide-range of researchers. To ensure the probe?s function for different experiments or conditions, it will be validated to meet specific criteria for response time, accuracy, signal stability, sensitivity, precision and biocompatibility. It will also be tested in different animal models and environmental conditions to ensure its applicability to a diverse range of study sites, experiments and animal models. Continuous monitoring of oxygen and lactate levels will provide a clearer and more comprehensive picture of oxygen consumption, oxygen delivery to the tissues, lactate accumulation and lactate recovery in response to varied physiological challenges and stressors. This will be a major technological breakthrough for a number of NSF biology research communities, including physiology, ecology, energetics, conservation biology and exercise science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such a sensing platform can be used as a powerful tool in various biology studies to gain a better understanding of the correlation between molecular signaling and biomechanical physics in tissue remodeling. The research outcomes of this project will be disseminated through patent applications, technical demonstration and presentation in biological conferences, and journal publications.  Joint summer workshops will be organized to introduce nano/bio-mechanical sensing to both graduate and undergraduate students. Well-established programs at Rutgers such as the Rutgers Society for Women Engineers will be leveraged to recruit under-represented students including women and African American at both undergraduate and graduate levels, and to reach out to middle- and high- school students through open lab-tours. <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to achieve a wide variety of nanomechanical measurements of a 3D-cell culture, including rapid and broadband nanomechanical property mapping of multiple cells, mechanical stimulus and cell poking with precision force control, and simultaneous mechanical stimuli and mechanical measurement of cells. This research goal will be accomplished through the following four objectives: (I). A nano-manipulator with four degree-of-freedom (DOF) motions (two translational and two rotational) will be designed and built, and then integrated to a SPM system equipped with an inverted optical microscope. (II). A multi DOF nano-positioning stage will be designed and built to manipulate a cantilever probe, and integrated to the SPM system; (III). A suite of algorithms will be developed to integrate the above two manipulators with the SPM system to fulfill the desired cell stimuli and measurement functions; and (IV).

For decades HDX-MS studies have provided massive insight into how proteins function, but an ongoing shortcoming of HDX-MS is that it is highly susceptible to variations and two different laboratories can easily get different results when studying the same protein. By developing internal standards for these experiments this project seeks to standardize HDX-MS measurements so all researchers can make reliable comparisons among their data. One key strength of HDX-MS is that it can monitor subpopulations of protein structures, but in lieu of adequate software for data analysis, these subpopulations often go unnoticed. This work will also develop software tools for robust analysis of HDX-MS data so these subpopulations, which are often highly relevant to understanding protein function, are accurately detected. The team will also provide outreach opportunities for K-12 students to be introduced to the power of cutting-edge analytical technologies. <br/><br/>The Guttman group uses HDX-MS to study many classes of proteins. HDX-MS has become a widespread approach for studying protein interfaces, directly measuring protein dynamics, and characterizing transient conformations that are often invisible to other techniques. Among the strengths of HDX-MS is the ability to analyze a broad range of protein systems including glycoproteins, membrane proteins, and large protein complexes that are often challenging, if not impossible, for most structural techniques. Notably, HDX-MS is proficient at detecting and characterizing when multiple conformations of a protein coexist. However, there remain some challenges that often limit the scope of information that is reliably obtained from HDX-MS studies including poor reproducibility, misinterpretation of apparent multiple conformational populations, and technical limitations with sample clean up. This project aims to address these challenges and expand the level of information and limits on complexity of systems amenable to HDX-MS through: 1) development of imidazolium-based small molecules to serve as robust internal standards to accurately measure solution exchange conditions; 2) development of an internal standard to accurately report percentage of deuterium content in a reaction; 3) establishment of a computation tool for accurately detecting and analyzing bimodal mass envelopes in samples containing multiple conformations. Overall, these developments are expected to make HDX-MS studies significantly more reproducible and informative.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite its importance, lactate has never been continuously measured in freely-moving animals. With this device, which will also measure oxygen, glucose and temperature, researchers can continuously measure lactate and other variables in active, resting, diving or hibernating animals in the field or under controlled laboratory conditions. This new device will eliminate the impacts of having an investigator present since the implantable probe can be attached to a backpack recorder, allowing free movement of animals. The project will foster interdisciplinary collaborations between bioengineers and biologists from three different institutions and provide interdisciplinary scientific training for Ph.D. and undergraduate students and a postdoctoral fellow.  Using the development of this device as a teaching tool, this project will provide unique training through a summer course on instrument development for underserved high school students in partnership with a non-profit organization.  <br/><br/>This innovation project will use specialized chemical formulations and light sensing technology to develop a 0.7 mm diameter, flexible probe that provides highly accurate, rapid and continuous measurements of key parameters, including lactate and glucose.

To ensure the probe?s function for different experiments or conditions, it will be validated to meet specific criteria for response time, accuracy, signal stability, sensitivity, precision and biocompatibility. It will also be tested in different animal models and environmental conditions to ensure its applicability to a diverse range of study sites, experiments and animal models. Continuous monitoring of oxygen and lactate levels will provide a clearer and more comprehensive picture of oxygen consumption, oxygen delivery to the tissues, lactate accumulation and lactate recovery in response to varied physiological challenges and stressors.

Even with these advantages, standard methods to assess physiological and molecular characteristics are often labor intensive and are typically limited to observing only one or a few traits. This project aims to transform this process, integrating recent advancements in automated image acquisition, machine learning, and specialized data analysis to concurrently capture and interpret numerous physiological and molecular traits, significantly enhancing data collection efficiency.

Specifically targeted biological applications will be on cell sorting based on cell?s size or mechanical stiffness, microinjection of genes into living cells, and selective collection of cell-containing droplets in a microfluidic channel. As the transducers are based on bulk acoustic waves, the technology offers tweezing live cells without force limitation, heat, or requirement of transparent media. Moreover, since the transducer focuses acoustic energy only on a very small spot and is capable of delivering acoustic energy through an intermediate solid, it can be applied to various microfluidic platforms for management of cells, liquids, particles and proteins. The transducer?s electrical controllability on the location/direction of the trapping force, combined with amenability of the transducers being formed into an array, allows the creation of complex biochemical assays and/or biomedical treatments at high throughput. Thus, the transducer?s unprecedented capability of capture and on-demand manipulation of living cells and/or particles (tens - hundreds of microns in diameter) in three dimensional (3D) space will open up many new possibilities in cell study, gene transfection, juxtaposition and manipulation. Sets of the transducers and power amplifiers will be delivered to four selected biological labs during the years 2 and 3 of the research period so that the labs may use them for sorting, gene delivery or any other biological experiments in their labs. The results of the research will be incorporated into the second edition of the principal investigator?s textbook on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), entitled ?Fundamentals of MEMS,? as well as in the MEMS curriculum at USC. Outreach activities will include research experience for undergraduate and high school students who will be excited with the experiments involving cells and microparticles.

Specifically targeted biological applications of the capture and move will include gene microinjection (through sonoporation) and lipid-mediated gene delivery. Also developed will be MFT-based cell sorting in microfluidic channels as well as formation and collection of cell-containing droplets in a microfluidic channel. An advanced version of MFT having two overlapping circular electrodes has been shown to make the ultrasonic waves arrive at a narrow region along the vertical axis with constructive wave interference to create a narrow Bessel-beam-like focal zone with long depth-of-focus. This process also produces bottle beams and quasi-Airy beams where radiation force toward the inner region exists and thus, multiple particles can be trapped. This advanced version along with various other versions of MFT will be developed, optimized and tested for the specific biological instrumentations. Electrical controllability of the tweezing location in 3D space will be developed so that the captured cells may be: (1) moved from one location to another, (2) stretched or compressed, (3) brought into contact with other cells or gene-containing liposomes, all upon electrical command signal without having to move the transducers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Proteins are dynamic machines that interact with other molecules to perform myriad functions required for life.  Three dimensional structures of proteins determined using X-ray crystallography reveal their atomic construction, provide insight into how they function and malfunction, and provide the basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms of protein function. Even more could be learned if these static structures could be complemented by ?molecular movies? of proteins in action, for example, as they catalyze chemical reactions to generate new molecules. The technology to be developed here promises to provide an effective and efficient approach to making these ?movies? with millisecond time resolution, allowing time-resolved crystallography to be applied to far more biomolecular targets by more researchers at more diverse institutions. This development work will engage a diverse science and engineering team, with efforts made to recruit participants who will benefit most from the hands-on and interdisciplinary training provided.  If this work is successful, there is a clear path for commercial development to maximize the technology?s impact. These research efforts are complemented by longstanding efforts in undergraduate education and teacher training.  <br/><br/>Powerful methods using free-electron laser X-ray sources have been developed for time-resolved study of biomolecular reactions initiated by light or by chemical mixing, but their application is resource intensive and not well suited to broad scientific and biotechnological use.  An alternative approach has been demonstrated in which reactions initiated in crystals are quenched within tens of milliseconds by ultra-rapid cooling, and X-ray data collected from these crystals via standard mail-in cryocrystallography. This approach separates the timescale of the reaction from that of X-ray data collection, yields more useful data per crystal, and minimizes the number of crystals required for structure determination at each time point. Here, instrumentation and methods for reaction initiation and rapid cooling will be developed to decrease achievable time resolution toward 1 ms, and key parameters for design of time-resolved experiments will be measured.  The goal is to deliver a solution for millisecond time-resolved studies of protein dynamics that can be used by anyone in their home lab on any protein crystal system that can host the reactions and/or structural changes of interest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Across the globe, freshwater and marine ecosystems are threatened by the effects of multiple environmental stressors including pollutants, invasive species, climate change, acidification, and excess nutrients. Excess nutrients are of particular importance since they are a driver of harmful algal blooms and ?dead zones,? which are increasingly occurring around the world and can tip ecosystems toward significant and potentially catastrophic ecological events. While scientists strive to monitor, understand, and model the effects of excess nutrients, the current major challenge is to frequently monitor nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]) dynamics using real-time sensors at a reasonable cost. Having high-frequency, real-time nutrient data would allow basic and applied researchers around the world to integrate nutrient data with other data from existing sensor networks and remote sensing to address the global challenge of harmful algal blooms and dead zones. The research will also integration exciting K-12 outreach efforts among the four research groups. Using team experts from different disciplines, the groups will work together to create educational modules that spiral knowledge from basic to advanced information to educate and engage broadly. These groups will create week-long summer programs that integrate in-person and virtual educational experiences for high school students and college undergraduates to learn about the importance of analytical chemistry, engineering, and limnology to produce new generations of aquatic sensors. Students will visit and participate in the research of state-of-the-art facilities at Queen?s University, Dublin City University, and Rensselaer, as well as the sensor network that has been deployed by RPI on Lake George, NY (in collaboration with IBM Research and The Lake George Association).<br/><br/>Most nutrient monitoring today by researchers depends on collecting water samples infrequently and bringing them back to the lab for benchtop testing. Newer technologies for measuring nutrients in aquatic ecosystems are single-use or require the frequent replacement of reagents. Moreover, the few nutrient sensors that are field-deployable with real-time data?such as phosphorus sensors?have a high cost ($30k) that strongly limits the number of nutrient sensors that can be deployed. Aquatic researchers need real-time, high-frequency, low-cost nutrient sensors with low detection limits that can be embedded in existing sensor networks that monitor suites of other water variables. This research team proposes to build a single sensor that uses 1) polymers to separate and concentrate each form of nitrogen, 2) bacteria to convert each form of nitrogen into a single form (i.e., nitrite), 3) advanced 3D printed microfluidics to ensure routes toward the active sensor in a complete analyzer platform for field deployment, and 4) a more sensitive detection system using novel ultrasensitive detectors. Monitoring the real-time dynamics of aquatic nutrients in complex natural environments has the potential to bring transformative new insights into how these nutrients impact aquatic ecosystems, with a focus on the global issue of harmful algal blooms. Such insights are crucial for improving capabilities to understand, predict, and mitigate these impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current imaging systems cannot image thick samples with high resolution. This project will overcome this limitation by developing an instrument that will provide thick-sample imaging with high resolution. This project will integrate research and education to stimulate interest in Optical Engineering, providing students with a unique set of skills for succeeding in their professional careers. Optical Engineering is the field of study that focuses on the development and application of optics and photonics, including instrumentation. In this project, five educational activities are focused on transferring the knowledge of Optical Engineering. These educational activities include the following: (1) an online Optical Engineering Certificate; (2) a Summer Workshop in Advanced Optical Microscopic Techniques; (3) the creation of a STEM club in Lausanne Collegiate School so high-school students can develop science projects that are generally not possible in science classrooms; (4) a partnership with the Pink Palace Museum to expose the public to optics and microscopy; and (5) summer internships to undergraduate students, exposing them to research activities and new career paths. This project has several broader impacts. The most important broader impact is the enhancement of the imaging infrastructure for biological research and expanding our knowledge of cell behavior. Another significant broader impact is the increase in career opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. During this project, the PI will create research, education, and scientific outreach videos using the YouTube platform. These videos will provide hands-on demonstrations of building imaging systems and the use of optical tools to align them. Students involved in this project will participate in these videos, allowing them to develop a deeper understanding of the topic and improving their communication skills. The videos will be available in English and Spanish audio to support the educational growth of Hispanic students across the United States.<br/><br/>Available methods of light microscopy do not enable three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution (SR) imaging of thick (>50 ?m) biological samples without staining.

This project will enable biological investigators to advance their knowledge of a large number of biological questions relating to cell growth and dynamics as well as for investigating cell behavior in thick tissue slices. The intellectual merit of the proposed imaging system includes novel advances in hardware and computational methods. The evaluation of the proposed system will be performed using calibrated manufactured objects and relevant biological specimens including human neuroblastoma cells, primary murine stem cells, and murine blastocysts. The interdisciplinary team involved in this project will systematically compare images obtained with the proposed system with images from existing methods including confocal microscopy, the Lionheart FX system, and the NanoLive platform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The education plan integrates undergraduate and high school students into the research activities where they will learn a broad set of skills at the interface of engineering, optics, and plant biology. The project will support student career development through international conference participation and individual mentorship. A 3d-printed, low-cost computational microscopy platform built around a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera will be developed as a pedagogical tool to teach optics concepts through microscopy. The project will also support the development of a curriculum of hands-on experiments to accompany the hardware platform and guide students as they explore light-matter interactions and computational microscopy techniques. Annual workshops will be offered at HMC for undergraduate and local high school students to attract students to STEM fields and offer experiential learning opportunities in engineering.<br/><br/>The scientific research goal of the project is to exploit the light-piping property of plant stems and roots to develop the next generation of optical tools to investigate plant roots and their surrounding environments. Roots and their local underground environment play a critical role in plant health and growth. In addition to physically anchoring and stabilizing the plant, the roots provide a pathway to acquire resources from the soil and establish a chemical and biological link between the plant and the below-ground environment. This means that information about the root system is critical for plant biology and agricultural studies both in the laboratory and the field, providing quantitative metrics for monitoring and improving plant growth, productivity, and sustainability. Unfortunately, soil is not transparent at optical wavelengths and stymies direct imaging of the root systems. Current strategies to overcome this challenge include using a transparent growth medium, glass-walled imaging systems called rhizotrons, or alternative imaging methodologies such as X-ray computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography. However, these solutions are expensive and offer the ability to probe only a small fraction of the overall root system. The goal of this project is to develop a minimally-invasive instrument that will inject light into the stem and root system, capturing and analyzing the backscattered light to map out the root structure. The project will explore two main instrument architectures for achieving this goal: time-of-flight detection and low-coherence interferometry. In the development process, the instruments will also be used to explore the optical properties of plant stems and roots. In addition to the publication of results from this project in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at scientific conferences, instructions on how to build and operate the instruments will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When viewed on a relative scale, the fastest legged animals on the planet are the smallest of invertebrates. Organisms such as beetles, cockroaches, and mites are capable of running at speeds of tens to hundreds of body lengths per second. These remarkable feats of movement at the microscopic scale are enabled by strong limbs, robust foot attachment mechanics, and resilient exoskeleton structures that give these organisms locomotor capabilities vastly different from their larger counterparts. Yet smaller organisms also have to contend with incredibly complex and unstructured substrates that can impose step-to-step height variations equal to or larger than their leg length. This research will develop general principles of legged locomotion in complex environments which could contribute to the development of new legged robots that can move more effectively in unstructured environments. In parallel with the research aims, educational experiences for K-12, undergraduate, and academic professionals to better integrate living systems literacy into engineering curriculum will be developed. These activities include funded summer research experiences for underrepresented students in collaboration with a local Title 1 high school. At the college level, course development, hands-on training for undergraduate and graduate students, and interdisciplinary workshops for researchers in engineering and biology will be implemented. The overall goal of these efforts is to enable engagement, communication, and collaboration between engineers and biologists, facilitated through living systems literacy. <br/><br/>This research project uses modeling and experiment to develop new geometric and dynamic scaling principles for legged locomotion in centimeter- and millimeter-scale organisms. Experiments will be performed with invertebrates that vary in size by four orders of magnitude in mass (the American cockroach, the Argentine ant, and the mite). To develop geometric scaling principles between animal morphology and natural substrates, a new experimental substrate-scanning platform to identify the three-dimensional topography of natural substrates will be developed. To study the dynamic scaling principles of force production and acceleration, new force measurement platforms to measure the ground-reaction forces involved in microscale legged locomotion will be developed. These experiments will be supported by physical modeling and computational modeling to elucidate scaling laws for dynamic and geometric phenomena in legged locomotion. The combination of experiments, modeling, and theory will improve our understanding of the biomechanics of microscale legged locomotion. The overall aim of this work is to contextualize the regimes of legged locomotion across the microscopic to macroscopic scales. The research and educational aims of this work are highly interdisciplinary. Graduate and high-school students will receive extensive training in biomechanics, physics, and engineering. Students will present results of these studies at robotics, physics, and biology conferences, and the outcomes will be published in interdisciplinary journals.
