  abstract = {The design, construction, and performance of a harmonic radar transponder with a total mass of less than 500 μg is presented. The transponder is intended for insect tracking applications and consists of very fine wire and a small Schottky diode. It is designed for fundamental and harmonic frequencies of 10 GHz and 20 GHz, respectively. Compared to existing harmonic radar transponders, this transponder is easy to construct because the loop inductor can be implemented with a simple bend in the dipole conductor without degrading performance. Through careful design optimization, the conversion loss of the transponder is not impacted by the measures taken to minimize its mass. The expected harmonic power versus the transmitted power is estimated based on the link analysis between the transmitter and receiver of the radar, with the link analysis itself being performed via calculation, harmonic balance simulation, and full-wave simulation. The link analysis simulation predicted a received power of -66.4 dBm for a transmitted power of +22 dBm and a range of 2.4 m. The measured received power level at the harmonic frequency, obtained from the broadside of the transponder in an anechoic test chamber, is approximately -70 dBm, which agrees well with the link analysis. Simulated and measured transponder radiation patterns are also compared and show good agreement. Low-mass transponders such as this enable tracking of smaller insects without reducing their lifespan or compromising their ability to fly at natural altitudes and ranges.},

  abstract = {Extended ground level structures like roads or field edges can be important cues for navigating animals, seen for example in road-following pigeons. In a landscape devoid of skyline cues but with a rectangular grid of pathways and roads, we used harmonic radar to track free-flying bumble bees, Bombus terrestris. Individual bees consistently used ground level linear features for navigation in a wide range of behavioural contexts. Bee exploration flights, search behaviour and foraging routes were shaped by linear features, with bees frequently flying along and parallel to pathways and roads. Comparisons of flight trajectories across these behavioural contexts show that individuals modulated their use of linear features strategically with respect to their individual goals and experience. Bees searching for a feeder used linear features to target their search, while foragers often followed pathways to return to their hive without overshooting. These findings on a major pollinator have important implications for the placements of bee colonies for agriculture and floral resources for conservation.},

  abstract = {Computer programs for video tracking of animal movement are evolving increasingly efficient, using complex algorithms or artificial intelligence systems. Despite the consequent progress in this field, researchers still face some fundamental problems in the use of such programs. For example, the best-performing programs are often uneasy to use, and user-friendly programs require source videos recorded under strict conditions (e.g. homogenous environments, constant lighting and high resolution), which may be difficult to meet in both laboratory and field studies. We present here AnimalTA, a new program that tracks and analyses animal movement in diverse environments. This program aims to be accessible to everyone, including those without knowledge of coding and image analysis. AnimalTA allows to process rapidly a high number of videos and manage multi-arena tracking. It is adapted to follow the movement of targets in variable conditions, including heterogenous and complex environments, or in low-quality videos. AnimalTA provides tools for editing videos and correcting problems caused by camera tremors, light changes or perspective deformation. AnimalTA also allows the user to easily correct tracking errors and repeat the tracking in a subsample of the video. The target's identity can be personalized to facilitate video analysis. The tracking results can be analysed in AnimalTA to obtain many different variables related to the trajectory of each target, such as average speed, total distance travelled, latency to reach defined areas, distance to a defined point, distance to other individuals, number of contacts with others, explored surface, among others. Users can set and control different parameters for these analyses and directly view the results.},

  abstract = {An improved global positioning system (GPS)–based animal tracking system is needed to meet quickly evolving demands of ecological research, range livestock production, and natural resource management. Commercially available tracking systems lack the data storage capacity needed to frequently collect animal location data (e.g., 15-minute intervals or less) over long-term deployment periods (e.g., 1 year or more). Some commercial systems have remote data–download capabilities, reducing the need to recapture tagged animals for data retrieval, but these systems download data via satellite (Argos), global system for mobile communications (GSM) cellular telephone, or telemetry radio frequencies. Satellite systems are excessively expensive, and GSM cellular coverage is extremely limited within the United States. Radio-based systems use narrow-band very-high– or ultra-high frequencies requiring the user to obtain frequency allocations. None of these existing systems were designed to provide continual, real-time data access. The Clark GPS Animal Tracking System (Clark ATS) was developed to meet the evolving demands of animal ethologists, ecologists, natural resource managers, and livestock producers. The Clark ATS uses memory-card technology for expandable data storage from 16 megabytes to 8 gigabytes. Remote data downloading and program uploading is accomplished using spread-spectrum radio transceivers, which do not require narrow-band radio frequency allocations. These radios also transmit, at a user-defined time interval, a real-time, GPS-location beacon to any Clark ATS base station within range (about 24km or 15 miles line of sight). Advances incorporated into the Clark ATS make it possible to evaluate animal behavior at very fine spatial- and temporal-resolution over long periods of time. The real-time monitoring provided by this system enables researchers to accurately examine animal distribution and activity responses to acute, short-term disturbances relative to longer-term behavioral patterns. The Clark ATS also provides a huge time- and cost-savings to researchers and natural resource managers attempting to relocate a tagged animal in the field for direct observation or other operations. Resumen Se necesita un sistema mejorado de rastreo de animales basado en GPS para satisfacer las crecientes demandas de investigación ecológica, producción de ganado en pastizales y el manejo de los recursos naturales. Los sistemas de rastreo comerciales disponibles carecen de la capacidad de almacenaje de datos necesaria para colectar frecuentemente la localización del animal (por ejemplo, a intervalos de 15 minutos o menos) en un período largo de tiempo (un año o mas). Algunos sistemas comerciales tienen capacidad de descargar datos a larga distancia, reduciendo la necesidad de recapturar los animales marcados para recuperar los datos, pero estos sistemas descargan los datos vía satélite (Argos), a través de telefonía celular GSM o de radiofrecuencias de telemetría. Los sistemas de satélite son excesivamente caros y la cobertura de la telefonía celular GSM es extremadamente limitada dentro de Estados Unidos de América. Los sistemas basados en radio usan bandas estrechas de frecuencia VHF o UHF, requiriendo que el usuario obtenga asignaciones de frecuencia. Ninguno de los sistemas existentes fueron diseñados para proveer un acceso continuo en tiempo real. El Sistema de Rastreo de Animales Clark GPS (Clark ATS) fue desarrollado para satisfacer las demandas de los etólogos animal, ecólogos, manejadores de recursos naturales y productores de ganado. El Clark ATS utiliza tecnología de tarjeta de memoria para expandir la capacidad de almacenaje de datos de 16 megabytes a 8 gigabytes. La descarga remota de datos y la carga del programa se logra usando radio transcriptores de espectro amplio, que no requieren la asignación de frecuencias de radio de banda angosta. Estos radios también transmiten, a un intervalo de tiempo definido por el usuario, en tiempo real, la localización de la baliza de GPS a cualquier base de Clark ATS dentro del rango (aproximadamente 24km o 15 millas en línea recta). Los avances incorporados al Clark ATS hacen posible evaluar el comportamiento animal a una resolución espacial y temporal muy fina por largos períodos de tiempo. El monitoreo en tiempo real suministrado por este sistema permite a los investigadores examinar acertadamente la distribución de los animales y las actividades en respuesta a disturbios severos a corto plazo en relación a los patrones de comportamiento a largo plazo. El Clark ATS también proporciona grandes ahorros de tiempo y costos a los investigadores y manejadores de recursos naturales que intentan relocalizar en el campo a los animales marcados para realizar observaciones directas u otras operaciones.},

  abstract = {Individual decisions regarding how, why and when organisms interact with one another and with their environment scale up to shape patterns and processes in communities. Recent evidence has firmly established the prevalence of intraspecific variation in nature and its relevance in community ecology, yet challenges associated with collecting data on large numbers of individual conspecifics and heterospecifics have hampered integration of individual variation into community ecology. Nevertheless, recent technological and statistical advances in GPS-tracking, remote sensing and behavioural ecology offer a toolbox for integrating intraspecific variation into community processes. More than simply describing where organisms go, movement data provide unique information about interactions and environmental associations from which a true individual-to-community framework can be built. By linking the movement paths of both conspecifics and heterospecifics with environmental data, ecologists can now simultaneously quantify intraspecific and interspecific variation regarding the Eltonian (biotic interactions) and Grinnellian (environmental conditions) factors underpinning community assemblage and dynamics, yet substantial logistical and analytical challenges must be addressed for these approaches to realize their full potential. Across communities, empirical integration of Eltonian and Grinnellian factors can support conservation applications and reveal metacommunity dynamics via tracking-based dispersal data. As the logistical and analytical challenges associated with multi-species tracking are surmounted, we envision a future where individual movements and their ecological and environmental signatures will bring resolution to many enduring issues in community ecology.},

  abstract = {We describe an automated radio telemetry system (ARTS) designed for estimating the location of 0.50 g butterflies which was constructed with commercially available materials. Previously described systems were not designed to estimate fine-scale locations of large insects within approximately 200 m2 study areas. The ARTS consists of four receiving stations. Each receiving station has four 3-element, directional Yagi antennae (separated by 60) connected to an automated receiver that records detected power sequentially from each antenna. To develop and evaluate the ARTS performance, four receiving stations were installed in the corners of 4 and 6.25-ha square fields with varying heights of vegetative cover. The location of a 0.22 g transmitter was estimated with a statistical method implementing both distance-and angle-power relationships. Calibrated model parameters were based on power detected from transmitters at known locations. Using independently collected data, model performance was evaluated based on estimated locations of a georeferenced stationary transmitter, a moving transmitter with a known georeferenced path and a transmitter attached to a monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus. Estimated locations were calculated as frequently as every 5 s, which is at least 12 times greater than the sampling frequency previously reported for tracking insects. When sufficient power data were received, the median estimated locations of a transmitter attached to an investigator's hat were {$<$}16 m from the true location. The median effective radius of the 95\% confidence ellipse was 18.3 m for stationary targets and 15.9 m for a moving transmitter. Greater error in location estimation was expected when the transmitter was attached to a monarch butterfly due to interference from vegetation and variability in antenna orientation and transmitter height. As such, the median distance between the estimated and true locations was 72 m. After applying a correction for the effect of vegetation, median location error was reduced by 12 m. While our ARTS has likely reached the limit of current technology, the system is still a substantial methodological advancement for locating butterflies. Our efforts should provide a benchmark as technology improves.},

  abstract = {Telemetry using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and camera trapping are two widely used approaches to detect animal interactions involving wildlife. However, while the former follows an individual-based approach, the latter follows a population-based approach, which may lead to different outcomes when describing interaction networks. In this study, we compared the performance of GPS telemetry, regular grid camera trapping (CT-RG), and resource monitoring camera trapping (in which cameras are placed monitoring a valuable resource for animals, such as water or food; CT-RM) in detecting and quantifying animal interactions. We used spatially explicit simulated trajectories of 150 individuals of 3 imaginary species. We simulated 9 different scenarios of resource visiting frequency and spatial resource aggregation in the environment to assess the potential influence of animal behavior and landscape structure. The simulated trajectories were sampled using the three approaches with six different sampling efforts each, and the direct and indirect interactions between the three species were quantified. Additionally, CT-RG and CT-RM were applied in Doñana National Park to evaluate their differences and limitations in field application. In terms of simulation, CT-RM offered the best performance in detecting direct interactions, and GPS achieved good performance when using a high number of fixes per hour. Both CT-RM and GPS also achieved good performance in detecting indirect interactions. CT-RG, on the other hand, missed most direct and indirect interactions, but correctly identified the pairs of species that interacted indirectly at some point. In the field trial, CT-RM and CT-RG detected almost the same number of species pairs interacting indirectly. However, CT-RG missed at least half of the species pairs that interacted directly. The spatial aggregation of the resource favors the performance of GPS over CT-RM, while the opposite occurs when the frequency of animal visits to the resource increases. To summarize, CT-RM is the most reliable method for detecting interactions when resource monitoring is feasible (e.g., small ponds in arid areas). Otherwise, GPS may show better performance, although it may miss direct interactions if a high fix rate is not used. Finally, the use of CT-RG should be limited to identify which species could potentially interact indirectly, but not to quantify these interactions.},

Although substantial advancements have been made in methods of measuring and quantifying variation in motion capacity, navigational capacity and external environmental parameters in recent decades, the role of internal state in animal migration (and in movement in general) is comparatively little studied. Recent studies of animal movement in the wild illustrate how direct physiological measurements can improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying movement decisions. In this review, we synthesize and provide examples of how recent technical advances in the physiology-related fields of energetics, nutrition, endocrinology, immunology and ecotoxicology provide opportunities for direct measurements of physiological state in the study of animal movement. We then propose a framework for practitioners to enable better integration of studies of physiological state into animal movement ecology by assessing the mechanistic role played by physiology as both a driver and a modulator of movement. Finally, we highlight the current limitations and research priorities for better integration of direct measurements of animal physiological state into the study of animal movement.},

Recent technological and conceptual advances have improved our ability to assess the causes and consequences of individual movement, and led to the emergence of the new field of ‘movement ecology’. Here, we outline how movement ecology can contribute to the broad field of biodiversity research, i.e. the study of processes and patterns of life among and across different scales, from genes to ecosystems, and we propose a conceptual framework linking these hitherto largely separated fields of research. Our framework builds on the concept of movement ecology for individuals, and demonstrates its importance for linking individual organismal movement with biodiversity. First, organismal movements can provide ‘mobile links’ between habitats or ecosystems, thereby connecting resources, genes, and processes among otherwise separate locations. Understanding these mobile links and their impact on biodiversity will be facilitated by movement ecology, because mobile links can be created by different modes of movement (i.e., foraging, dispersal, migration) that relate to different spatiotemporal scales and have differential effects on biodiversity. Second, organismal movements can also mediate coexistence in communities, through ‘equalizing’ and ‘stabilizing’ mechanisms. This novel integrated framework provides a conceptual starting point for a better understanding of biodiversity dynamics in light of individual movement and space-use behavior across spatiotemporal scales. By illustrating this framework with examples, we argue that the integration of movement ecology and biodiversity research will also enhance our ability to conserve diversity at the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels.},

  abstract = {Researchers studying avian space use, dispersal, survival, and migration select tracking tags that optimize tag size (dimensions) and mass relative to the focal species to minimize risk to birds as they move and fly. Here we argue that antenna length and transmitter color are also critical tag design parameters that must be considered. Based on a review of the songbird tracking literature and unpublished cases, we found most cases of entanglement, which can result in bird injuries and death, occurred with longer antennas ({$>$}13 cm). However, such cases cannot infer rates of mortality or survival, nor may they be representative of entanglements across antenna lengths and studies using radio tags. Additionally, white or brightly colored transmitters that contrast with plumage, particularly of cryptically colored females and juveniles, may increase visibility to predators and result in higher mortality, or alternatively, cause a female to eject a nestling by mistaking the tag for a fecal sac or foreign object. Consequently, we call on researchers to report and publish cases of antenna entanglement, and for journal editors to encourage and applaud such reports, such that data can be compiled to inform guidelines on tag antenna lengths for different species. Future research is also needed to examine the impacts of tag color on parental behavior and survival of tagged birds. Meanwhile, researchers should strive to ensure that their tag color does not contrast markedly with avian plumages, while also taking care not to alter (i.e., do not color over) areas required for harness attachment, activating and deactivating tags. We hope such efforts will enable researchers and manufacturers to make more informed decisions about tracking tag design, particularly with respect to balancing the benefits of longer antennas, which provide greater power and detection distance, with risks of bird entanglement and mortality.},

Video imagery can capture rich information about animals and their environments, but image-based approaches are often impractical due to the challenges of processing large and complex multi-image datasets and transforming resulting data, such as animals' locations, into geographical coordinates. We demonstrate a new system for studying behaviour in the wild that uses drone-recorded videos and computer vision approaches to automatically track the location and body posture of free-roaming animals in georeferenced coordinates with high spatiotemporal resolution embedded in contemporaneous 3D landscape models of the surrounding area. We provide two worked examples in which we apply this approach to videos of gelada monkeys and multiple species of group-living African ungulates. We demonstrate how to track multiple animals simultaneously, classify individuals by species and age–sex class, estimate individuals' body postures (poses) and extract environmental features, including topography of the landscape and animal trails. By quantifying animal movement and posture while reconstructing a detailed 3D model of the landscape, our approach opens the door to studying the sensory ecology and decision-making of animals within their natural physical and social environments.},

Future aquatic integrative biology and ecology studies will increasingly rely on data from electronic tagging. Continued advances in tracking hardware and software are needed to provide the knowledge required by managers and policymakers to address the challenges posed by the world's changing aquatic ecosystems. We foresee multiplatform tracking systems for simultaneously monitoring the position, activity, and physiology of animals and the environment through which they are moving. Improved data collection will be accompanied by greater data accessibility and analytical tools for processing data, enabled by new infrastructure and cyberinfrastructure.

  abstract = {Over the last 30 years, harmonic radars have been effective only in tracking insects flying at low altitude and over flat terrain. We developed an innovative harmonic radar, implementing the most advanced radar techniques, which covers a large field of view in elevation (with an angular aperture of about 24°) and can track insects up to a range of 500\,m. We show all the components of this new harmonic radar and its first application, the tracking of Vespa velutina (yellow-legged Asian hornet). This is an invasive species which, although indigenous to South-East Asia, is spreading quickly to other regions of the world. Because of its fast diffusion and the serious threat it poses to both honeybee colonies and to humans, control measures are mandatory. When equipped with a small passive transponder, this radar system can track the flight trajectory of insects and locate nests to be destroyed. This tool has potential not only for monitoring V. velutina but also for tracking other larger insects and small size vertebrates.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The dispersal of animals from their birth place has profound effects on the immediate survival and longer-term persistence of populations. Molecular studies have estimated that bumblebee colonies can be established many kilometers from their queens’ natal nest site. However, little is known about when and how queens disperse during their lifespan. One possible life stage when dispersal may occur, is directly after emerging from hibernation. Here, harmonic radar tracking of artificially over-wintered               Bombus terrestris               queens shows that they spend most of their time resting on the ground with intermittent very short flights (duration and distance). We corroborate these behaviors with observations of wild queen bees, which show similar prolonged resting periods between short flights, indicating that the behavior of our radar-monitored bees was not due to the attachment of transponders nor an artifact of the bees being commercially reared. Radar-monitored flights were not continuously directed away from the origin, suggesting that bees~were not intentionally trying to disperse from their artificial emergence site. Flights did not loop back to the origin suggesting bees were not trying to remember or get back to the original release site. Most individuals dispersed from the range of the harmonic radar within less than two days and did not return. Flight directions were not different from a uniform distribution and flight lengths followed an exponential distribution, both suggesting random dispersal. A random walk model based on our observed data estimates a positive net dispersal from the origin over many flights, indicating a biased random dispersal, and estimates the net displacement of queens to be within the range of those estimated in genetic studies. We suggest that a distinct post-hibernation life history stage consisting mostly of rest with intermittent short flights and infrequent foraging fulfils the dual purpose of ovary development and dispersal prior to nest searching.},

  abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.                            ”Now we must consider in general the common reason for moving with any movement whatever.“ (Aristotle,               De Motu Animalium               , 4th century B.C.)},

Future monitoring techniques must be systematic and global. Advanced technologies and computer solutions are needed. We provide here a review of relevant works to show the high potential for solving the aforementioned problems. Major historical and modern methods of insect monitoring are considered. All major radar solutions are carefully reviewed. Insect monitoring with radar is a well established technique, but it is still a fast-growing topic. The paper provides an updated classification of insect radar sets. Three main groups of insect radar solutions are distinguished: scanning, vertical-looking, and harmonic. Pulsed radar sets are utilized for all three groups, while frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) systems are applied only for vertical-looking and harmonic insect radar solutions. This work proves the high potential of radar entomology based on the growing research interest, along with the emerging novel setups, compact devices, and data processing approaches. The review exposes promising insect monitoring solutions using compact radar instruments. The proposed compact and resource-effective setups can be very beneficial for systematic insect monitoring.},

The resulting tracks gave information on length, direction and straightness of foraging routes. Superimposition onto a map of the foraging landscape allowed interpretation of the bees’ destinations in relation to the spatial distribution of forage.                                         4.               \enspace Outward tracks had a mean length of 275·3{$\quad$}±{$\quad$}18·5{$\quad$}m (               n               {$\quad$}={$\quad$}65) and a range of 70–631{$\quad$}m, and were often to forage destinations beyond the nearest available forage. Most bees were constant to compass bearing and destination over successive trips, although one bee was tracked apparently switching between forage patches. Both outward and return tracks had a mean straightness ratio of 0·93{$\quad$}±{$\quad$}0·01 (               n               {$\quad$}={$\quad$}99).

Such evaluations are required to underpin assessments of gene flow in bee‐pollinated crops and wild flowers. They are also required when making decisions about the management of bees as pollinators and the conservation of bee and plant biodiversity.},

These types of studies require observation and tracking of each animal in well-controlled and defined arenas, often for long timescales. Thus, these experiments produce long time series and a vast amount of data that require the use of software applications to automate the analysis and reduce manual annotation. In this review, we examine 28 free software applications for animal tracking to guide researchers in selecting the software that might best suit a particular experiment. We also review the algorithms in the tracking pipeline of the applications, explain how specific techniques can fit different experiments, and finally, expose each approach’s weaknesses and strengths. Our in-depth review includes last update, type of platform, user-friendliness, off- or online video acquisition, calibration method, background subtraction and segmentation method, species, multiple arenas, multiple animals, identity preservation, manual identity correction, data analysis and extra features. We found, for example, that out of 28 programs, only 3 include a calibration algorithm to reduce image distortion and perspective problems that affect accuracy and can result in substantial errors when analyzing trajectories and extracting mobility or explored distance. In addition, only 4 programs can directly export in-depth tracking and analysis metrics, only 5 are suited for tracking multiple unmarked animals for more than a few seconds and only 11 have been updated in the period 2019–2021.},

Movement is a core driver of those patterns so understanding how movement mechanisms give rise to space use patterns has become an increasingly active area of research. This study focuses on a particular strand of research in this area, based around step selection analysis (SSA). SSA is a popular way of inferring drivers of movement decisions, but, perhaps less well appreciated, it also parametrises a model of animal movement. Of key interest is that this model can be propagated forwards in time to predict the space use patterns over broader spatial and temporal scales than those that pertain to the proximate movement decisions of animals. Here, we provide a guide for understanding and using the various existing techniques for scaling up step selection models to predict broad-scale space use patterns. We give practical guidance on when to use which technique, as well as specific examples together with code in R and Python. By pulling together various disparate techniques into one place, and providing code and instructions in simple examples, we hope to highlight the importance of these techniques and make them accessible to a wider range of ecologists, ultimately helping expand the usefulness of SSA.},

Of particular interest are the potential impacts on habitat use patterns, energetics, and cascading impacts on fecundity and other life history traits for key wildlife species that are exposed to human activities. Statistical models quantifying effects of human activity on animal movement on a heterogeneous landscape are essential for understanding these potential impacts. Here we present a statistical framework for analyzing movement data that is based on the concept of a potential surface. The potential surface is motivated by the assumption that animals are moving on a space-time surface with regions or points of attraction or of repulsion. We demonstrate the use of the technique by analyzing movement data from a long-term controlled experiment to evaluate the responses of free ranging Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) to anthropogenic disturbances that vary in time and space. Our results demonstrated a strong avoidance of elk to all-terrain vehicles detected up to one km from the disturbance. Elk avoidance of mountain bikers was detected up to 500 m, and avoidance of hikers and horseback riders was detected to 200 m.},

The last two decades have seen phenomenal growth in capabilities for high-resolution remote sensing that increasingly offers opportunities to study small, but ecologically important organisms, such as insects. Here we review current applications for using remote sensing within entomological research, highlighting the emerging opportunities that now arise through advances in spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. Remote sensing can be used to map environmental variables, such as habitat, microclimate and light pollution, capturing data on topography, vegetation structure and composition, and luminosity at spatial scales appropriate to insects. Such data can also be used to detect insects indirectly from the influences that they have on the environment, such as feeding damage or nest structures, whilst opportunities for directly detecting insects are also increasingly available. Entomological radar and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), for example, are transforming our understanding of aerial insect abundance and movement ecology, whilst ultra-high spatial resolution drone imagery presents tantalising new opportunities for direct observation. Remote sensing is rapidly developing into a powerful toolkit for entomologists, that we envisage will soon become an integral part of insect science.},

  abstract = {Most of our current knowledge about the behaviour of insects flying at high altitude has been derived directly from observations made with conventional entomological radars. Until recently it was not possible to apply this very powerful technique to study the behaviour of insects flying close to the ground because the strong radar echoes, reflected from ground features and from vegetation (‘clutter’), almost always mask the very weak signals returned from insects. This constraint has been overcome, at least for insects weighing more than ≈50 mg, by the development of an harmonic radar, and of transponder tags small enough to be carried by these insects without impeding their flight performance. Because the transponders have to be carried by insects in flight, extreme miniaturisation was obviously essential and it was achieved by using a passive, frequency-doubling technique, so that no on-board battery was needed. Transponders with all-up weights of between 1 and 12 mg were produced, the weights varying according to the degree of mechanical robustness required. The frequency-doubled signals from the transponder are selectively detected by the radar so that the tagged insects can be located even in the presence of very strong clutter. The system has three major advantages over conventional visual and video methods of observing low-flying insects. Firstly, and most importantly, its range of operation (up to 900 m) allows surveillance and flight tracking over hundreds of thousands of m2, i.e. four orders of magnitude greater than is possible with conventional methods. Secondly, it provides dynamic and geometrically correct records of the insects’ horizontal flight paths and thirdly, it works equally well by day and night. The technique has introduced a new era in the study of insect flight at low altitude.},

This then suggests that dispersal play a central role in the response of populations and species to ever-increasing global change, including climate change, habitat loss and fragmentation, and biological invasions. During a symposium held at Lund University (Sweden), the causes and consequences of dispersal were discussed, and here we provide an overview of the talks. As the discussions often gravitated towards the role and our understanding of dispersal in a changing world and given the urgent challenges posed by it, we place this overview in the context of global change. We draw and discuss four conclusions: (i) methodological advances provide opportunities for improved future studies, (ii) dispersal distances can be much greater than previously thought (examples in plants and vertebrates), but also much more restricted (examples in micro-organisms), (iii) dispersal is more dynamic than we often care to admit (e.g. due to individual variation, effects of parasites, variation in life history, developmental and evolutionary responses, community impacts), (iv) using results of dispersal research for detailed prediction of outcomes under global change is currently mostly out of reach – nevertheless, that should not stop us from showing the many negative consequences of global change, and how dispersal is often a limiting factor in adapting to this.},

  abstract = {Interpolation of geolocation or Argos tracking data is a necessity for habitat use analyses of marine vertebrates. In a fluid marine environment,characterized by curvilinear structures, linearly interpolated track data are not realistic. Based on these two facts, we interpolated tracking data from albatrosses, penguins, boobies, sea lions, fur seals and elephant seals using six mathematical algorithms. Given their popularity in mathematical computing,we chose Bézier, hermite and cubic splines, in addition to a commonly used linear algorithm to interpolate data. Performance of interpolation methods was compared with different temporal resolutions representative of the less-precise geolocation and the more-precise Argos tracking techniques. Parameters from interpolated sub-sampled tracks were compared with those obtained from intact tracks. Average accuracy of the interpolated location was not affected by the interpolation method and was always within the precision of the tracking technique used. However, depending on the species tested, some curvilinear interpolation algorithms produced greater occurrences of more accurate locations, compared with the linear interpolation method. Total track lengths were consistently underestimated but were always more accurate using curvilinear interpolation than linear interpolation. Curvilinear algorithms are safe to use because accuracy, shape and length of the tracks are either not different or are slightly enhanced and because analyses always remain conservative. The choice of the curvilinear algorithm does not affect the resulting track dramatically so it should not preclude their use. We thus recommend using curvilinear interpolation techniques because of the more realistic fluid movements of animals. We also provide some guidelines for choosing an algorithm that is most likely to maximize track quality for different types of marine vertebrates.},

Entomology-related monitoring methods based on radar, machine vision, and other technologies have developed rapidly in recent years. This research focuses on real-time, laser-based monitoring methods that enable online monitoring of insect activity and study the response of insect populations to changes in environmental conditions such as weather. We summarise four specific applications of monitoring insects based on various laser remote sensing techniques, including setting the electronic trap, collecting backscattered light or fluorescence from target insects in open space, and indirectly monitoring insect population activity by drawing forest canopy characteristics. We discuss the application opportunities of these methods and the challenges faced in practical monitoring and emphasise the trends and requirements for future research.},

  abstract = {Tracking animals over large temporal and spatial scales has revealed invaluable and spectacular biological information, particularly when the paths and fates of individuals can be monitored on a global scale. However, only large animals (greater than ∼300 g) currently can be followed globally because of power and size constraints on the tracking devices. And yet the vast majority of animals is small. Tracking small animals is important because they are often part of evolutionary and ecological experiments, they provide important ecosystem services and they are of conservation concern or pose harm to human health. Here, we propose a small-animal satellite tracking system that would enable the global monitoring of animals down to the size of the smallest birds, mammals (bats), marine life and eventually large insects. To create the scientific framework necessary for such a global project, we formed the ICARUS initiative(www.IcarusInitiative.org),the International Cooperation for Animal Research Using Space. ICARUS also highlights how small-animal tracking could address some of the `Grand Challenges in Environmental Sciences' identified by the US National Academy of Sciences, such as the spread of infectious diseases or the relationship between biological diversity and ecosystem functioning. Small-animal tracking would allow the quantitative assessment of dispersal and migration in natural populations and thus help solve enigmas regarding population dynamics,extinctions and invasions. Experimental biologists may find a global small-animal tracking system helpful in testing, validating and expanding laboratory-derived discoveries in wild, natural populations. We suggest that the relatively modest investment into a global small-animal tracking system will pay off by providing unprecedented insights into both basic and applied nature.Tracking small animals over large spatial and temporal scales could prove to be one of the most powerful techniques of the early 21st century, offering potential solutions to a wide range of biological and societal questions that date back two millennia to the Greek philosopher Aristotle's enigma about songbird migration. Several of the more recent Grand Challenges in Environmental Sciences, such as the regulation and functional consequences of biological diversity or the surveillance of the population ecology of zoonotic hosts, pathogens or vectors, could also be addressed by a global small-animal tracking system.Our discussion is intended to contribute to an emerging groundswell of scientific support to make such a new technological system happen.},

  abstract = {Insect pollinators such as bumblebees play a vital role in many ecosystems, so it is important to understand their foraging movements on a landscape scale. We used harmonic radar to record the natural foraging behaviour of Bombus terrestris audax workers over their entire foraging career. Every flight ever made outside the nest by four foragers was recorded. Our data reveal where the bees flew and how their behaviour changed with experience, at an unprecedented level of detail. We identified how each bee’s flights fit into two categories—which we named exploration and exploitation flights—examining the differences between the two types of flight and how their occurrence changed over the course of the bees’ foraging careers. Exploitation of learned resources takes place during efficient, straight trips, usually to a single foraging location, and is seldom combined with exploration of other areas. Exploration of the landscape typically occurs in the first few flights made by each bee, but our data show that further exploration flights can be made throughout the bee’s foraging career. Bees showed striking levels of variation in how they explored their environment, their fidelity to particular patches, ratio of exploration to exploitation, duration and frequency of their foraging bouts. One bee developed a straight route to a forage patch within four flights and followed this route exclusively for six days before abandoning it entirely for a closer location; this second location had not been visited since her first exploratory flight nine days prior. Another bee made only rare exploitation flights and continued to explore widely throughout its life; two other bees showed more frequent switches between exploration and exploitation. Our data shed light on the way bumblebees balance exploration of the environment with exploitation of resources and reveal extreme levels of variation between individuals.},

  abstract = {Functional diversity is commonly used to assess the conservation value of ecosystems, but we have not yet established whether functional and taxonomic approaches are interchangeable or complementary to evaluate community dynamics over time and in response to disturbances. We used a five-year dataset of dung beetles from undisturbed forest, primary forest corridors, and Eucalyptus plantations to compare the sensitivity of conceptually equivalent metrics to temporal variation in different anthropogenic disturbances. We compared species richness with functional richness, Pielou's evenness with functional evenness, and Simpson's diversity with Rao's quadratic entropy. We assessed the sensitivity of the metrics to anthropogenic changes. The indices showed complex patterns among habitat types, with with similar responses in some cases and not in other, and little incongruence between the pairs within the same year. The influence of disturbance on longer-term temporal variation over the five-year period revealed lower temporal variation in functional than taxonomic metrics. Both approaches showed greater variation in plantations compared to native forests. We evaluated the variation in taxonomic and functional metrics between consecutive years and among habitats. Most metrics showed similar shifts between years in all habitats, except for species and functional richness. We demonstrate that even conceptually similar indices may not provide similar information on dung beetles responses to disturbance. However, the differences between the indices can yield key insights about the drivers of change, especially over the long-term. It is important to use taxonomic and functional diversity in tandem to better understand community responses to environmental and anthropogenic changes.},

  abstract = {Human-modified forests, including plantations and managed forest, will be a major component of tropical landscapes in the near future. To conserve biodiversity across modified tropical landscapes we must first understand what influences diversity in planted areas. We studied dung beetle communities in Eucalyptus plantations to assess the influence of local (canopy openness and soil texture) and landscape factors (surrounding native forest cover) on taxonomic and functional diversity, and to determine whether biodiversity in plantations is affected by timber production. Dung beetle community composition in Eucalyptus plantations was largely explained by the surrounding native forest cover, as Simpson's diversity and functional diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy) increased with the extent of native forest in buffer areas. However, the abundance of dung beetle species associated with native forest was not explained by any of the explanatory variables. The coarse sand content of the soil explained much of the functional similarity between plantations and native forests, as well as variation in dung beetle community structure. The total abundance of dung beetles in plantations increased with coarse sand content, whereas body mass declined, and dung beetle abundance and functional originality decreased with canopy openness. Timber production intensity did not explain the variation in any of the measured diversity parameters. If enhancing biodiversity in plantations is a management goal, then these results highlight the importance of restoring or retaining native forest areas in modified landscapes. They also suggest that integrated management could improve biodiversity in Eucalyptus plantations without reducing timber production.},
